UF HEALTH FLORIDA RECOVERY CENTER, held itself out to be a program qualified to
provide services, treatment, and evaluation of physicians who were referred to it, by the
Professional Resources Network (hereafter "PRN") as was Plaintiff, DR. MAYOR-DAVIES.
15.                                                                                                  The Defendant, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA BOARD OF TRUSTEES,  is
vested by law with all the powers and authority to effectively govern and set policy for the
University of Florida in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida and with regulations and
rules of the Board of Governors.

had the understanding and agreement that her program length would be between thirty (30) and

program.

agents, and representatives, deviated from and fell below the accepted standard of care, and
within a reasonable degree of medical probability proximately caused injury to Plaintiff.  The
Defendant breached its duty of care to the Plaintiff in many ways, including but not limited to the
following:
a)                                                                                                    By requiring DR. MAYOR-DAVIES to be subjected to a restrictive level of treatment not
recommended by the physician who had initially evaluated DR. MAYOR-DAVIES;
b)                                                                                                    By improperly and without medical or factual basis making a diagnosis of DR. MAYOR-
DAVIES that was inappropriate and incorrect;
c)                                                                                                    By failing to assemble and document sufficient evidence to support the assessment that
the program made of DR. MAYOR-DAVIES;
d)                                                                                                    By failing to create a treatment plan for DR. MAYOR-DAVIES and failing to assemble
and document sufficient evidence to medically justify that treatment plan in a restrictive
setting;
e)                                                                                                    By failing to consider the potential risks of treatment before commencing to provide said
treatment;
f)                                                                                                    By failing to give DR. MAYOR-DAVIES the opportunity to give informed consent to the
treatments that she received, or to be informed of the potential risk of that treatment;
g)                                                                                                    By failing to present treatment alternatives in a realistic way, and representing to Plaintiff
that her only alternative was to comply with the treatment plan offered her by the
Defendant or to surrender her medical license;
h)                                                                                                    By failing to provide DR. MAYOR-DAVIES, at the time of her enrollment in the
program, a projected discharge date, or criteria for readiness for discharge, even though
the Plaintiff asked for same repeatedly;

i)                                                                                          The Defendant failed to  inform DR.  MAYOR-DAVIES  in a timely manner that
participation in family meetings was mandatory before discharge, which caused a
significant delay in her discharge and prolonged her treatment unnecessarily;
j)                                                                                          Despite the Plaintiff's repeated expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment she was
receiving from the Defendant, the Defendant through its employees, representatives, and
agents failed to investigate her grievances, and resolve or mitigate them, rather her
protests were treated as evidence of her illness and character flaws;
k)                                                                                          The Defendant failed to establish the treatment environment necessary to  form a
therapeutic alliance with Plaintiff, and even when the Defendant through its employees,
agents, and representatives knew that whatever therapeutic alliance existed was in peril,
they did nothing to evaluate what had gone wrong, or work to improve their working
relationship with the Plaintiff;
1)                                                                                          The Defendant breached the duty of care to the Plaintiff, and was negligent in that its acts
and omissions fell below that level of care, skill, and treatment which in light of all
relevant  circumstances,  is  and  was  recognized  as  acceptable  and  appropriate  by
reasonable similar health care providers.  The acts and omissions included but were not
limited to the following:
