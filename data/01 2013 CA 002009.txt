FIRST DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA
CHASE CORBIN,
Appellant,                                                                                             Cases No. 1D12-1088
v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLANT'S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
OF THIRTY (30) DAYS IN WHICH TO FILE INITIAL BRIEF
COMES NOW the Appellant, CORBIN CHASE, by and through undersigned counsel, to
request an extension of time of 30 days in which to file his initial brief. As grounds therefore the
following is stated:
1.                                                                                                     Mr. Corbin is appealing the final order of his suspension from the University of
Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions of the Conduct
Code. Mr. Corbin's initial brief is due today, May 9, 2012, or seventy (70) days after he filed the
notice of appeal. See Fla. R. App. P. 9.110(f).
2.                                                                                                     Rule 9.110(e) of Appellate Rules of Procedure provides that the clerk of the
administrative agency prepare the record within fifty (50) days of the filing of the notice of
appeal. Rule 9.190(5) provides that taped testimony must be transcribed and made part of the
record before transmission to the Court.
3.                                                                                                     The University of Florida has served on Mr. Corbin a transcription of the eight
plus hours' administrative hearing which is incoherent, inaccurate, and out of order. Although
undersigned counsel has an audio file of the hearing, preparing a brief by listening to the CD is
1

impractical, both because of the amount of time that would be required to listen and re-listen to
portions of the file, and because counsel would be unable to cite to the audio file.
4.                                                                                                  On May 4, 2012, Counsel for the University, Amy Hass, indicated by phone that
she will ensure that a more accurate transcript is produced for reference by undersigned counsel
as soon as practicable. On May 7, 2012, Ms. Hass indicated she does not oppose this motion for
extension of time while the record is prepared.
WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin moves that this motion for a 30-day extension of time for
filing his initial brief be granted.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the
General Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL
32611-3157, on this the 7th day of May, 2011. It is my intent that this filing be accepted by the
court pursuant to my agreement that submitting this document for filing creates the same
obligations as my original signature would create on a paper document.

v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLANT'S SECOND UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
OF THIRTY (30) DAYS IN WHICH TO FILE INITIAL BRIEF
COMES NOW the Appellant, CORBIN CHASE, by and through undersigned counsel, to
request an extension of time of 30 days in which to file his initial brief. As grounds therefore the
following is stated:
1.                                                                                                     Mr. Corbin is appealing the final order of his suspension from the University of
Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions of the Conduct
Code. Mr. Corbin's initial brief is due Thursday June 7, 2012.
2.                                                                                                     The University initially provided undersigned counsel with a transcript of the
student conduct hearing below that is not an accurate representation of those proceedings. Thus,
the University has agreed to have the hearing transcribed a second time. As of the date of this
motion, it was not yet complete. Although undersigned has an audio recording of the hearing,
much of it is inaudible.
3.                                                                                                     Undersigned counsel contacted Counsel for the University, Amy Hass, who has
indicated she does not oppose a thirty-day extension.

WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin moves that this motion for a 30-day extension of time for
filing his initial brief be granted.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the
General Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL

Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions of the Conduct Code.
2.                                                                                                     Undersigned counsel and the University have been in discussions about the content of
the record provided in this case and the University has agreed to supplement the record with several
documents Mr. Corbin believes are relevant to his appeal.
3.                                                                                                     The University also is still searching its records for additional documents requested
by Mr. Corbin that could be relevant to these proceedings.
4.                                                                                                     Mr. Corbin, therefore, requests additional time in which to file his initial brief
following compilation of the final record, as agreed to by both parties.
5.                                                                                                     Undersigned counsel has contacted Counsel for the University, Amy Hass, who has

indicated she does not oppose a thirty-day extension.
6.                                                                                                         Mr. Corbin is not filing this motion for purposes of delay and undersigned counsel
has already drafted as much of Mr. Corbin's brief that is feasible without the supplemental record.
WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin moves that this motion for a 30-day extension of time for filing
his initial brief be granted.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the General
Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL 32611-3157, on
this the 8th day of July, 2011. It is my intent that this filing be accepted by the court pursuant to my
agreement that submitting this document for filing creates the same obligations as my original
signature would create on a paper document.

CHASE CORBIN,
Appellant,                                                                                                 Cases No. 1D12-1088
v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLANT'S FOURTH UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
OF THIRTY (30) DAYS IN WHICH TO FILE INITIAL BRIEF
COMES NOW the Appellant, CHASE CORBIN, by and through undersigned counsel, to
request an extension of time of 30 days in which to file his initial brief. As grounds therefore the
following is stated:
1.                                                                                                         Mr. Corbin is appealing the final order of his suspension from the University of
Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions of the Conduct Code.
2.                                                                                                         Undersigned counsel and the University have been in discussions about the content of
the record provided in this case and the University has agreed to supplement the record with several
documents Mr. Corbin believes are relevant to his appeal. This process is ongoing.
3.                                                                                                         In addition, the audio recording of the conduct hearing below does not reflect the
names of many of the speakers; thus, the parties are working together to attempt to fill in the relevant
missing names.
4.                                                                                                         Finally, the University's Record on Appeal is not in compliance with all provisions of
Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.200. It is Appellant's understanding that the University is in
the process of correcting and refilling the record.

5.                                                                                                        Mr. Corbin, therefore, requests additional time in which to file his initial brief
following compilation of the final record, as agreed to by both parties.
6.                                                                                                        Undersigned counsel has contacted Counsel for the University, Brande Smith, who
has indicated she does not oppose a thirty-day extension for Mr. Corbin's initial brief
7.                                                                                                        Mr. Corbin is not filing this motion for purposes of delay and undersigned counsel
has already drafted as much of Mr. Corbin's brief that is feasible without the supplemental record.
WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin moves that this motion for a 30-day extension of time for filing
his initial brief be granted.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Brande Smith, Office of the
General Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL 32611-
3157, brande@ufl.edu, on this the 4th day of August, 2012. It is my intent that this filing be accepted
by the court pursuant to my agreement that submitting this document for filing creates the same
obligations as my original signature would create on a paper document.

UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,

APPELLEE'S UNOPPOSED MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT
THE RECORD AND FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
COMES NOW the Appellant, CHASE CORBIN, and moves this Honorable Court to
permit filing of a supplemental record containing internal University of Florida emails and other
documents not originally made part of the record, and a revised, more accurate transcription of
the proceedings below. As grounds therefore the following is stated:
1.                                                                                                    The University of Florida filed the Record on Appeal with this Court on June 18,
2012.
2.                                                                                                    Following review of several internal University emails and other documents
provided for Appellant's counsel, the parties have agreed to supplement the record with those
that are relevant to this Appeal. In addition, Appellant and Appellee have agreed that the original
transcription of the record below was inaccurate and incomplete; thus, the Amended Record will
contain a new transcription. Appellee has no objection to supplementation.
3.                                                                                                    Mr. Corbin's brief currently is due on September                                   7, 2012. He respectfully
requests an additional 14 days following supplementation of the record to file his initial brief

WHEREFORE, by agreement of the parties, Appellant moves that the Court permit
Appellee, the University of Florida, to supplement the record on appeal with a revised, more
accurate transcription of the proceedings below and several other documents relevant to this
appeal.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been emailed to Brande Smith and Amy Haas,
Office  of  the  General  Counsel,  University  of  Florida,  at  amhass@UFL.EDU  and

v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLEE'S SECOND UNOPPOSED MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT
THE RECORD AND FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
COMES NOW the Appellant, CHASE CORBIN, and moves this Honorable Court to
permit filing of a supplemental record containing internal University of Florida emails and other
documents not originally made part of the record, and a revised, more accurate transcription of
the proceedings below. As grounds therefore the following is stated:
1.                                                                                                  On  August                                                                                        30,    2012, Mr. Corbin filed Appellee's Unopposed Motion to
Supplement the Record and For Extension of Time. On September 4, 2012, the Court denied the
motion for lack of specificity with leave to file again. Mr. Corbin now files this more specific
motion.
2.                                                                                                  The University of Florida filed the Record on Appeal with this Court on June 18,
2012.
3.                                                                                                  Following review of several internal University emails and other documents
                                                                                                    provided for Appellant's counsel, the parties have agreed to supplement the record with several
that are relevant to this Appeal.
4.                                                                                                  First, Mr. Corbin seeks to supplement the record with several emails between

members of the University of Florida Office of the Dean of Students, the Appellant, his
attorneys, and the complainant. They pertain to procedural and evidentiary matters related to the
Student Conduct Hearing Mr. Corbin underwent at the University of Florida, the appeal of which
is now under review by this Court.
5.                                                                                                  Second, Mr. Corbin seeks to supplement the record with the materials given to the
University of Florida Student Conduct Committee prior to his hearing, which the Committee was
permitted to consider in rendering a decision on the sanctions before them.
6.                                                                                                  Third.  Mr.  Corbin  seeks to supplement the record with a more accurate
transcription of the Student Conduct hearing before the University of Florida Student Conduct
Committee below. This hearing formed the basis for the Committee's finding that Mr. Corbin
was guilty of the alleged misconduct, which in turn led to his suspension and the denial of his
appeal                                                                                              (the final order under review in the case at bar); thus, an accurate and complete
transcription is critical to this Court's review. The parties agree that the original transcript
submitted to this Court is both out of order and inaccurate and that a revised transcript is
necessary to preserve Mr. Corbin's due process rights.
7.                                                                                                  The documents referenced in paragraphs four and five above are as follows:

Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution, and Jen Day Shaw, Assistant

v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
JOINT STIPULATION REGARDING
AMENDED RECORD ON APPEAL
The parties have reached the following agreement regarding the Record on Appeal, of
which they move that the Court take judicial notice:
1.                                                                                                       The Second Amended Record on Appeal contains several internal University of
Florida documents that include redacted items. These redactions are meant to protect the privacy of
the student whose complaint resulted in Mr. Corbin's suspension. Because some of the documents
will be referenced by Mr. Corbin in his briefs, and because the identification of the complainant is
critical to the understanding of those documents, the parties stipulate that the redactions on the
following pages are of the complainant's name: Vol. 1, pp. 32, 65, 67; Vol. 1-A, pp. 107, 109, 110,
178; Vol. 2, p.                                                                                          192.
2.                                                                                                       The parties also stipulate that the University of Florida has made its best effort to
produce the most accurate transcription of the disciplinary hearing below. Because the complainant
appeared at the hearing by phone, and because the hearing was taped for subsequent transcription,
rather than recorded by a court reporter, not all of the hearing was audible to the transcriber or the
parties. The parties agree that the transcription provided for the Court is the most complete

transcription that they can collectively provide for review on appeal.

IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL
FIRST DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA
CHASE CORBIN,
Appellant,                                                                                              Cases No. 1D12-1088
v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLANT'S FINAL MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
OF SIXTEEN (16) DAYS IN WHICH TO FILE INITIAL BRIEF
COMES NOW the Appellant, CORBIN CHASE, by and through undersigned counsel, to
request an extension of time of 16 days in which to file his initial brief. As grounds therefore the
following is stated:
1.                                                                                                      Mr. Corbin is appealing the final order of his suspension from the University of
Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions of the Student Conduct
Code.
2.                                                                                                      The University and Mr. Corbin have been working diligently for several months to
compile a complete record on appeal in this case. Because this process has been a lengthy and
complicated one, in part due to missing portions of the record, the University has filed two motions
to supplement the record (at Mr. Corbin's request) and Mr. Corbin has filed and been granted four
extensions of time to file his initial brief while awaiting the amended record. Mr. Corbin's last
motion was for an extension of 14 days from the date the University filed the Amended Record (it
had not yet been filed when Mr. Corbin requested the extension).

3.                                                                                                    The Court granted the motion on September 6, 2011, and the University filed the
record that day, making Mr. Corbin's brief due September 20, 2012, the date of this motion.
4.                                                                                                    Undersigned counsel was too optimistic in asking for 14 days to file Mr. Corbin's
brief after receiving the Amended Record and therefore request an additional 16 days, making the
total request the customary 30 days after submission of a supplemental record. Although as
previously stated much of Mr. Corbin's brief had been drafted prior to September 6 based on the
documents Mr. Corbin knew would be contained in the record, he is now adding several new claims
based on the University's most recent submission. The Amended Record is four volumes and the
proceedings below were highly fact intensive.
5.                                                                                                    Moreover, undersigned counsel has spent four of the fourteen days provided
addressing an unforeseeable emergency in another case, requiring her to travel and take time away
from preparing Mr. Corbin's brief. This is Mr. Corbin's first request for an extension based on
counsel's work load rather than the delayed preparation of the record. Counsel takes very seriously
the Court's need to address cases efficiently and Mr. Corbin himself would like a speedy resolution
of this matter. Counsel asserts that this request is necessary to provide the best possible
representation for Mr. Corbin and is not meant for purposes of delay.
6.                                                                                                    Undersigned counsel has not had the opportunity to reach opposing counsel regarding
this motion in order to comply with the dictates of Publix Supermarkets, Inc. v. Arnold, 707 So. 2d
1161 (Fla. 5th DCA 1988). However, counsel for the University, Amy Hass and Brande Smith, have
previously informed undersigned counsel that they generally will not oppose extensions of time in
this case. Undersigned counsel will notify Ms. Hass as soon as possible so that she can inform the
Court of Ms. Hass' position on this specific motion.
2

WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin moves that this motion for a 16-day extension of time for filing
his initial brief, making thirty days the total number requested to prepare the brief following
supplementation of the record, be granted.
1 CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the General
Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL 32611-3157, on
this the 20th day of September, 2012. It is my intent that this filing be accepted by the court pursuant
to my agreement that submitting this document for filing creates the same obligations as my original
signature would create on a paper document.

IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA
FIRST DISTRICT
CHASE CORBIN,
Appellant                                                                                            CASE NO.: 1D12-1088
v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
NOTICE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITHIN COURT FILING, JOINT
MOTION TO SEAL THE RECORD ON APPEAL AND ALL AMENDED RECORDS,
AND JOINT MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD
The Appellant and Appellee respectfully move this Court to direct the Clerk of Court to
designate and maintain the Record on Appeal as confidential and seal these records pursuant to
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(d)(2). The parties also move that the Court order
that the record be supplemented with the Supplemental Record filed simultaneously with this
Motion. Both parties act in good faith, agree to the relief requested and the following facts that
support this Motion in accordance with Rule 2.420(d)(1)(B)(xiii):
1. This case comes before this Court as an Appeal of a Student Conduct Committee
decision finding the Appellant responsible for several violations of the Student
Conduct Code, including Sexual Battery.
2. The Record on Appeal and Amended Record on Appeal include numerous
documents,  including  transcripts,  reports,  and  photographs,  which  contain
information identifying a victim of sexual offenses.                                                 §§                    119.071   (2)         (h),   119.0714   (1)   (h),
Fla. Stat.
3. The parties have also identified some photographs of the victim and apartment
where the incident at issue occurred. They include twenty-six photos of the victim

that took and left on Appellant Corbin's computer after he was arrested, two
photos of Mr. Corbin after the incident, two photos of the bathroom where the
incident at issue happened, and one photo of the suitcase the victim packed for
Mr. Corbin following the incident.
4. These photos were presented to the Conduct Committee during the Student
Conduct Hearing via projector on behalf of Appellant Corbin. They were not
included in the Record on Appeal or Amended Record on Appeal because neither
party's counsel was aware of them. Both parties agree they should be in the
Amended Record on Appeal and that the pictures of the Victim must be filed
under seal pursuant to Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(d)(2). The
proposed Supplemental Record is being filed simultaneously with this Motion.
WHEREFORE, the parties jointly move that the Court grant this Motion to Supplement the
Record with the photographs described in paragraph 3 above and that the entire record, including
the Record on Appeal, the Amended Record on Appeal and the Supplemental Record on Appeal,
be placed under seal.

v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLANT'S MOTION TO FILE ENLARGED INITIAL BRIEF
COMES NOW the Appellant, CORBIN CHASE, by and through undersigned counsel, to
move for leave to file an enlarged initial brief, exceeding the page limit set by Florida Rule of
Appellate Procedure 9.210(a)(5) by 24 pages. As grounds therefore the following is stated:
1.                                                                                                     Mr. Corbin is appealing the final order of his suspension from the University of
Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions ofthe Student Conduct
Code.
2.                                                                                                     He has raised three claims addressing ten subclaims, each of which is highly fact-
intensive. In addition, Mr. Corbin has addressed competing case law regarding whether this Court
has jurisdiction to hear this case. That argument spans seven pages.
3.                                                                                                     Appellant is cognizant of this Court's high caseloads and limited time and resources
and has made every effort to reduce his initial brief as much as possible without waiving necessary
factual and legal arguments.
WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin moves that the Court grant him leave to file an enlarged brief in
excess of the 50-page limit by 24 pages, filed simultaneously with this motion.

I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the General
Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL 32611-3157, at
amhass@utledu, on this the 17th day of October, 2012. It is my intent that this filing be accepted by
the court pursuant to my agreement that submitting this document for filing creates the same
obligations as my original signature would create on a paper document.

v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLANT'S UNOPPOSED MOTION TO ACCEPT
INITIAL BRIEF OUT OF TIME
COMES NOW the Appellant, CORBIN CHASE, by and through undersigned counsel, to
move for leave to file his initial brief one day out of time. As grounds therefore the following is
stated:
1.                                                                                                      Mr. Corbin is appealing the final order of his suspension from the University of
Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions of the Student Conduct
Code. His brief was due October 16, 2012.
2.                                                                                                      Undersigned counsel suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome and was working to file Mr.
Corbin's brief on time, but found herself unable to type because of her condition (and the extensive
hours she has spent drafting Mr. Corbin's brief and then attempting to cut it from over 100 pages to
the 50-page limit). Her incapacity occurred after business hours on the due date so she could not
contact opposing counsel for her position on an extension.
3.                                                                                                      Counsel was able to finish and file the brief on October 17, one day late, despite
significant pain. She has contacted counsel for the University, Brande Smith, who has indicated she
has no opposition to Mr. Corbin filing his brief one day late.

WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin respectfully requests that the Court accept his initial brief one
day out of time due to undersigned counsel's medical condition.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the General
Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL 32611-3157, at

D.                                                             The Chair and Faculty Member of the Conduct Committee, the
Director of Student Conflict and Resolution, and the Dean of

Right to Due Process                                           44
II.                                                            THE UNIVERSITY BASED ITS ORDER ON FINDINGS OF FACT

THE  UNIVERSITY  FAILED  TO  AUDIBLY  RECORD  HIS
HEARING AND NEITHER PARTY CAN PROVIDE A RECORD
THAT IS BOTH COMPLETE AND ACCURATE ON APPEAL                   66
A.                                                             A Defendant is Entitled to a New Proceeding When the Record

Prejudiced his Presentation of Claims                          67
B.                                                             The Amended Record on Appeal Is So Incomplete and
Inaccurate that the Court Cannot Complete a Full Review

Claims Has Been Compromised Such that the Court
Must Vacate the Final Order Below and Remand for a

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On March 18, 2011, Appellant Chase Corbin was informed by letter from
Chris Loschiavo, Assistant Dean and Director of Student Conduct and Conflict
Resolution for the University of Florida ("the University"), that the University had
received information from the Gainesville Police Department indicating Mr.
Corbin may have violated the University's standards by committing a sexual
battery against his ex-girlfriend,                                                     at an off-campus residence on
February 9, 2011.                                                                      (Vol. I at 29.) Accordingly, the University charged him with
three violations of Administrative Code Regulation                                     6C1-4.041(4), its Student
Conduct Code:
(b)[(1)] Sexual Assault — Any sexual act or attempt to engage in any
sexual act with another person without the consent of the other person
or in circumstances in which the person is unable, due to age,
disability, or alcohol/chemical or other impairment, to give consent.
(b)[(2)] Sexual Misconduct — Any intentional intimate touching of
another without the consent of the other person or in circumstances in
which the person is unable, due to age, disability, or alcohol/chemical
or other impairment, to give consent.
(c)[(1)] ... Harassment or threats — Verbal or written threats, coercion
or any other conduct that by design, intent or recklessness places
another individual in reasonable fear of physical harm through words
or actions directed at that person, or creates a hostile environment in
which others are unable reasonably to conduct or participate in work,
education, research, living, or other activities, including but not
limited to stalking, cyber-stalking, and racial harassment.

Id.
Mr. Corbin was granted a hearing before the Student Conduct Committee,
comprised of three students and two faculty members. (Vol. I at 60-2; Vol. II at
202, 204.)   Although the University initially imposed an interim suspension and
trespass order on Mr. Corbin, Vice President and Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw
lifted both on March 28, 2011, allowing him full access to the University.            (Vol. I
at 34.)
On December 2, 2011, the Student Conduct Committee, presided over by
Mr. Loschiavo, held a hearing on the allegations against Mr. Corbin.  Following
the hearing, the Committee recommended that Mr. Corbin be found responsible for
all three allegations against him and that he be suspended from the University from
Spring semester 2012 through Spring semester 2013. It also recommended no
contact order vis-à-vis Ms.                                                           , and that he undergo sexual violence and anger
management counseling. Mr. Corbin's registration, transcript, degree certification
and diploma were also placed on hold. (Vol. I-A at 159-61.)
On December 15, 2011, Dean Shaw notified Mr. Corbin by letter that she
concurred with the recommendations of the Conduct Committee. The suspension
was imposed and an overlay was placed on his record indicating he was not in
good standing. Mr. Corbin was informed he might have to reapply for admission in
2

spring 2013. Finally, Mr. Corbin could not have any intentional contact with
and had to undergo counseling. Id. at 183-84.
On December 22, 2011, Mr. Corbin filed an appeal with Dr. Mary Kay
Carodine, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs for the University of
Florida. Id. at                                                                          186-90.  The appeal was denied on January 17, 2012.  However,
Vice President Carodine adjusted the sanctions by allowing Mr. Corbin to meet
with her in September 2012, to discuss readmission in Spring 2013. Id. at 195-6.
The denial states that it "constitutes the final decision of the University of Florida
with respect to this matter." Id. at 196.
A timely notice of appeal was filed with this Court on February 3, 2012. Id.
at 200.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Mr. Corbin and Ms.                                                                       were interrupted in their joint apartment by
Gainesville Police Department (GPD) officers on February 9, 2011, following a
phone call from Michael Hengelbrok, Ms.                                                  's boyfriend.   Mr. Hengelbrok
indicated that he was awakened by a phone call from Ms.                                  's cell phone at
11:22 a.m. When he picked up the phone, he heard Ms.                                     screaming in the
background for someone to get off her.  Mr. Hengelbrok "immediately got up and
began driving to her apartment." He received calls from the phone a total of four
3

times between 11:37 and 11:53 a.m., but Hengelbrok did not pick up.
Ms.                                                                                    told GPD Corporal Richard Armstrong that she and Mr. Corbin
had been in a relationship until approximately two months before the incident, but
were living together out of financial necessity. Id. She had stayed with Mr.
Hengelbrok, her current boyfriend of six weeks, id at 1-a, 7; Vol. II at 252-53, for
the prior three nights because she was growing increasingly scared of Mr. Corbin.
She came home on February 9 to feed her pets, gather some work, and take a
shower before going to class.                                                          (Vol. I at 1-a.)
Ms.                                                                                    told Detective Lorraine Fair, who arrived on the scene with
Detective Victoria Young, after Cpl. Armstrong, that Mr. Corbin was home when
Ms.                                                                                    arrived, dressed only in a brown coat. After returning from walking her
dog, Mr. Corbin asked her if she would "come home." He tried to give her a
booklet he had written for her, but she told him she had to go to class and he put
the booklet in one of her shoes. He then went out to his car to get her project for
school, which he had been storing for her. She went into the bathroom to take a
shower, locking the door. Id at 7; Vol. II at 279.
Ms.                                                                                    reported that while she was in the shower, Mr. Corbin entered the
bedroom and somehow unlocked her cell phone to look at whom she had been
4

calling. He then verbally confronted her from outside the bathroom door. I When
she told him to leave her alone, he kicked open the bathroom door and asked her
whom she had been sleeping with. She exited the shower and told him to leave her
alone and then got back into the shower.                                                 (Vol. I at                                                                          1-a; see also Vol. 2 at 279.)
Mr. Corbin disrobed and entered the shower. Despite Ms.                                                                                                                      's repeated requests
that he leave, he "forcibly penetrated her vagina with his penis."                                                                                                           (Vol. I at                      1-a;
                                                                                         Vol. 2 at 280.)  At that point, "she no longer had the energy to defend herself."
(Vol. I at 1-a.) Cpl. Armstrong's report indicated that according to Ms.                                                                                                                                     , Mr.
Corbin was inside her only a few seconds and did not ejaculate. Id.
Ms.                                                                                      told Det. Fair that when Mr. Corbin got in the shower, he "pushed
[Ms.                                                                                     up against the wall ... and pushed his penis into her vagina from behind
a few times." She told him to stop.                                                      (Vol. I at 7-8) (emphasis added). When they
both exited the shower she ran to the bedroom closet to change. He followed her
with the phone in his hand and was screaming and crying. When she tried to get
the phone back, he kept throwing it so she could not reach it. Mr. Corbin pushed
her down in the closet, though she said she got dressed while there. Id. at 8; Vol. II
at 280.
Det. Fair's report reflected that Ms.                                                    then crawled out into the living
Ms.                                                                                      told Det. Fair that she did not remember what Mr. Corbin said to
her in the bathroom, but that he kept calling her a "whore." (Vol. I at 7.)
5

room and Mr. Corbin was still screaming at her, ripping up the poem he had
wanted her to read.                                                                    (Vol. I at 8.) He then threatened to kill himself with a rope in
the loft and took out a KA-Bar knife and held it up, asking her if she wanted him to
go to jail, that he would fight Hengelbrok. This continued until the police arrived.
(Vol. I at 8; see also Vol. 2 at 281.)
When asked later if she had any injuries from the incident, Ms.                        told
Det. Fair that when Mr. Corbin was on top of her in the closet, he kissed and
sucked on her neck, leaving marks there.                                               (Vol. I at 8.) Ms.                                                 refused a rape
examination because the attack happened in the shower and she said Mr. Corbin
did not ejaculate. Id; see also Vol. II at 288.
Of the three voicemail messages on Mr. Hengelbrok's phone, only one
contains Mr. Corbin's voice and is transcribed as follows: "Listen to me, you
mother fu**er cock sucker. Stay away from                                              . She's mine. And if you don't
think she's mine, why don't you ask her who she was with this morning, who she
let inside of her. B**ch."                                                             (Vol. I at                                                         9.) The other two messages contain Ms.
's voice, crying. In one, she can be heard screaming, "Give me my phone" and
"Stop it."                                                                             (Vol. III at 424.)
At the Conduct Hearing, Cpl. Armstrong told the Committee that after
questioning Ms.                                                                        , he went outside and asked Mr. Corbin to tell him what had
6

happened. Appellant told him he had gone to check on Ms.                                because she had
fainted in the shower. She yelled at him to get out when he asked whom she had
been seeing and then she "grabbed his pants and pulled them off of him, leading
him into the shower." They then had consensual sex, after which Ms.                     started
yelling at him again. Id. at 1-a. Armstrong alleged that after taking this statement,
Cpl. Armstrong instructed GPD Officer Hinson to advise Mr. Corbin of his
Miranda rights, at which point Appellant requested to speak with his lawyer. Id at
1-a, 2.
When Det. Fair and Det. Young subsequently arrived on the scene, Cpl.
Armstrong did not mention the above statement when conveying to her the details
of his investigation. Id at 7. Thus, Det. Fair testified, "Mr. Corbin had opted—I
guess when patrol was talking to him that he wanted to speak to a lawyer, so we
didn't interview him."                                                                  (Vol. 2 at 281.) Det. Young, however, wrote in her report
that Cpl. Armstrong informed her that Mr. Corbin was being detained in Officer
Hinson's patrol car and she went to speak with him. Young reported that Mr.
Corbin spontaneously offered the same statement he had relayed to Cpl.
Armstrong, despite having previously invoked his Fifth Amendment right to
silence which, according to Young, he did again after speaking with her. Id. at 6.
Cpl. Armstrong concluded that Mr. Corbin had forcibly, sexually battered

Ms.                                                                                  and placed him under arrest. Id. at 2. However, a month later, on March
8, 2011, the Eighth Judicial Circuit State Attorney's office filed a Case Action
Report of No Information dismissing all charges against Mr. Corbin. (Vol. II at
151.)
On February                                                                          11, 2011, two days after the incident, Ms.                                took the
initiative to contact Det. Fair and inform her that Mr. Corbin had some marijuana
and paraphernalia in the apartment and he smoked pot "on a daily basis." She had
also found Mr. Corbin's KA-Bar knife, which he had gestured with on the morning
of the incident. Id. at 10.
Ms.                                                                                  's written Narrative, which was given to the Committee prior to the
Hearing, contains inconsistencies with her statements to police. For example, she
does not actually say in her Narrative that Mr. Corbin entered her while they were
in the shower: "In the shower, he demanded that he was the only guy I had been
with and that I was his while he pinned me facing the wall and tried to enter me."
She "gradually resisted less." When he then left her alone in the bathroom, she
hurried into her closet.                                                             (Vol. I at 14-5; compare id. at 8) (reporting to GPD that
when they both exited the shower she ran to the bedroom closet to change and he
followed her).
Still another version was presented at the Conduct Hearing. Ms.                      told
8

the Committee that while she was taking her shower, Mr. Corbin burst open the
door and called her a whore, asking her who she was sleeping with. For the first
time she asserted that she got out of the shower not just to ask him to leave, but to
try to get her phone back, but he held it out of reach. They struggled for it and he
slapped her arms down. (Vol. II at 217-18.) She also mentioned for the first time
that Mr. Corbin was kissing her all over her neck in the shower with her back
towards the wall.  When she moved away from him, he turned her around and
entered her. Then, "[h]e turned me around again after that and that's when
[inaudible] and he was kissing me all over." Id. at 217-18. At that point, she was
able to push him away. Id. at 218-19; compare Vol. I at 1-a (he penetrated her and
she no longer had the energy to defend herself); Vol. II at 299 (Det. Fair testifying
that Ms.                                                                                had not struggled at all once in the shower:  "she was too tired to
fight him and she just basically stood there.").   Ms.                                  continued that he
persisted with kissing her and she gave up. When he got out, she rinsed her hair
and "got out of there." Id at 219.
Cpl.  Armstrong told the Committee he arrived at the apartment at
approximately noon, id. at 275, which contradicted his report reflecting that the
incident was not even reported until 2:07 p.m. on the 9th, and contradicted Ms.
's narrative that the incident, which started between 10:30 and 11:00 a.m., had
9

lasted "a few hours, as the police arrived in the afternoon."                          (Vol. I at 15; see also
Vol. II at 295 (Det. Fair confirming that police were called at 2:07 p.m.) But see
Vol. I at 9 (Mr. Hengelbrok's statement that he called the police immediately after
arriving at the apartment following the 11:22 a.m. phone call he received.).
Cpl. Armstrong testified that the door to the bathroom was bashed in. When
asked if he could tell if it was a "fresh kick," he responded, "Appeared to be," but
did not provide any factual basis for the conclusion. Id at 271. Despite being the
investigating officer, Cpl. Armstrong "didn't look into the bathroom too much."
As to whether there were any signs of struggle, he stated that he "couldn't see
anything on [Ms.                                                                       because she was so red and flushed in the face from crying
that if there were any marks on her I wouldn't have been able to see them right
then anyway." Id at 273. Although Mr. Corbin seemed "a little bit nervous" when
Armstrong arrived on the scene, "that's common when you go to domestic
disturbances." Id at 275.
Det. Fair testified that Ms.                                                           had bruises on her neck, but then offered
that rarely do they see any physical signs of violence unless the sexual attack was
very violent."                                                                         (Vol. 2 at 282.) She added that she had sent pictures of Ms.   's
neck to the Committee. See Vol. 1 at 51. Fair admitted that "bruises can come
from anything. I'm not a doctor, but to me the bruises—the marks were real red.
10

They looked fresh to me and also her demeanor was that of somebody who had
been just in a physical altercation." Id at 283 (adding again that she is not medical
personnel, but that the bruises "looked like they were ... within a day or two
They were basically red and purple, with no blue in them."). There is no evidence
in the record that Mr. Corbin choked Ms.                                                , nor even held her by the neck.
Det. Fair also offered her opinion on Ms.                                               's demeanor, testifying, "To
me she was presenting very typically of a victim."   Id. at                             286.                                                    But Fair
acknowledged she doesn't know how Ms.                                                   is normally, as well as that "sexual
battery victims don't react in a typical way." Id; see also id at 288 ("To me, she
was presenting as a victim of some sort of violence. I mean—I guess anybody can
have consensual sex and act any kind of way.").
When asked if there were any other injuries, Det. Fair acknowledged that the
officers did not ask Ms.                                                                to take off her clothes—she was just asked if she was
injured anywhere else. Id at 285. Det. Fair noticed the "hole" in the bottom of the
bathroom door, but "there was no way if this                                            [sic] was fresh or anything like
that[.]"  It was approximately four inches wide. Id.  She did not investigate the
bathroom at all, nor did she check the lock on the bathroom door.  She just
responded "for the sexual battery investigation, which mostly included talking to
and [inaudible] at that point because Mr. Corbin opted to speak to his lawyer
11

so we didn't talk to him." Id at 286, 289, 291-92.
Detective Fair took into evidence the poem that Mr. Corbin said he had
written for Ms.                                                                       on their 18-month anniversary. Id. at 289. She also took into
custody a letter Ms.                                                                  reported was written by Mr. Corbin. Neither the poem
nor the letter were given to the Committee or appear in the record on appeal. Fair
entered excerpts from the booklet in her report.                                      (Vol. I at 10-1.)
Det. Fair noted four times in as many pages of testimony that Mr. Corbin
invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, so would not speak
to the officers.  Id. at                                                              293-96.  Because Mr. Corbin had taken and passed a
polygraph test, Det. Fair was asked about their reliability. She told the Committee
that they can be an effective law enforcement tool and GPD uses them. The Chair
then asked, on behalf of Mr. Corbin, whether she was aware that Mr. Corbin had
taken a polygraph test.  Instead of answering with a simple yes or no, Det. Fair
used the opportunity to comment on Mr. Corbin's silence yet again, and imply that
Mr. Corbin's polygraph examiner might not be well-credentialed because he does
not work for GPD:
Nope, as I said Mr. Corbin opted not to talk to law enforcement. If he
had, one of his options would have been that he would have been
allowed to take a polygraph by our polygraph examiner. I don't know
the polygraph examiner that you're speaking of and I would have to
consult with our polygraph examiner to find out his credentials.
12

Id. at 295. Again noting that she was "not a trained polygrapher," she continued to
weigh in on their accuracy, ,stating that very few people can fool a polygraph test,
but "a person can show deception or not deception                                       [sic] based on how the
questions are asked                                                                     So it just depends on who's giving the polygraph, what
their credentials are, and honestly, what their stake in it is."  Id at 296.  She
acknowledged that if the person taking the test believed that sex between him and
another person was consensual, and answered yes if asked whether it was, then it
would register as a truthful answer." Id. at 296-97 (adding again that it would be
better to ask a polygrapher and that GPD has a few of them).
Ms.                                                                                     was then permitted to ask Det. Fair "her impression" of Mr.
Corbin's jail calls to his father, which are summarized in Det. Fair's report, but
which the Commission did not have. (Vol. I at 10-1.)  She recounted the most
inflammatory parts of the calls, i.e., that TJ Corbin kept reminding his son that the
calls were recorded so that he would not comment on the case, and that Mr. Corbin
was crying during one call and "said that all women were kind of [inaudible]," that
was a "bitch," and that he started to say another name, likening the two, but
that "his father told him to be quiet                                                   They did not talk freely on the phone.
We'll just leave it at that."                                                           (Vol. II at 297.)
Det. Fair did not address Mr. Corbin's description of the incident on the
13

calls, which was entirely consistent with his testimony to the Committee. He told
his father that he and Ms.                                                           had fought over                                                                      's relationship with Mr.
                                                                                     Hengelbrok and he asked her if she was "fu**ing him." She said no, took his pants
                                                                                     off, pulled him into the shower by his genitalia, and told him she would show him.
                                                                                     He admitted having called Mr. Hengelbrok. He thought that                            had set him up
                                                                                     and said whatever she needed to say to get him in jail.                              (Vol. I at 12.)
Mr. Corbin relayed the same events to the Committee, with more detail.
Several days before the incident, Ms.                                                told Mr. Corbin she was going to stay
with a friend, Delisha White, and probably would not come home that night. She
stayed away for three nights.                                                        (Vol. II at 311-12.) On February 9, Ms.                                              came
home at 10:45 a.m. He read her his anniversary poem and she asked him for a ride
to class. She also needed the program from the play they had attended because it
was a class assignment, so he went to his car to get it.
When he returned to the apartment from his car, he found Ms.                         's cell
phone (unlocked) on the counter and started to look through her texts because he
had doubts about her fidelity. He found that she had not been with her friend over
the past several days, but rather, with her "now apparent" boyfriend. Id. at 312.
Ms.                                                                                  had sent sexually explicit emails to Mr. Hengelbrok that were painful for
Mr. Corbin to read. He went to speak with her in the bathroom. He did not attempt
14

to open the door by force, though he admitted to kicking it and creating a small
hole at foot level. Id. at 324. Ms.                                                    then came to open the door. Id. 312-13;
353.  Mr. Corbin pointed the Committee to pictures in the record demonstrating
that neither the lock nor the door frame of the door was in any way damaged. Id.
at 316; Vol. I at 48; Supp. Rec. at 428.
Mr. Corbin also admitted to calling Ms.                                                a "whore" when he entered the
bathroom because he had just read text messages on her phone telling another man
she needed him inside of her.  Id. at 348.  He asked Ms.                                                                         if she had been
fu**ing Mr. Hengelbrok and "she reached down                                           [his] pants, grabbed                      [his]
genitalia, and said, 'Why don't you get in the shower and I'll show you if I've been
fu**ing him.'  Id. at 313.  She untied his pants and tried to kiss his neck and
manually arouse him, pulling him into the shower. He was still in love with her and
wanted her to tell him she wasn't sleeping with Mr. Hengelbrok, so followed her
into the shower, but was unable to maintain an erection so got out.  He did not
force himself on her. Id. at 359-60. After that, they fought again — Ms.               had no
explanation for the texts and he told her he did not want to see her again. She
screamed that she never loved him, that he should get away from her. She called
Hengelbrok and left the phone on while they argued. Ms.                                would not let Mr.
Corbin leave the apartment, telling him that Hengelbrok was a "real man and he
15

was going to kick [Chase's] ass."  Id. at 313-14.  Shortly after that, the police
arrived and he was taken to jail. Id. at 314.
Mr. Corbin denied making any statements to the police on February 9,
contrary to Armstrong's and Young's reports. He never spoke to Armstrong and in
fact made a conscious decision not to because of Armstrong's demeanor.  His
father was a lawyer and he knew "there was no point" in saying anything. Id. at
329.
Mr. Corbin told the Committee the marks on Ms.                                          's neck were from her
Taekwondo class, not him, and she acknowledged having attending a two-hour
class with Mr. Hengelbrok the night before the incident. Id. at 228, 315. During
the period in which the incident occurred, Mr. Corbin was attending physical
therapy for an impacted sternum and fractured shoulder blade, so asserted that
could not have forced Ms.                                                               against the wall of the shower. Id. at 317, 329-30;
see also id at 363, 371.
According to Mr. Corbin, the poem that was found by the police was not the
one he read to                                                                          on that day—he writes lots of poetry and it must have been
another one lying around in the apartment. Id at 327-28. This is consistent with
the fact that the police took into custody a booklet and a letter from the apartment.
Only one was excerpted in Det. Fair's report.                                           (Vol. I at 10-1.)
16

Mr. Corbin challenged many other statements Ms.                                      made to the
committee, including whether they had broken up the night before their camping
trip over Christmas (they had not); that he had forcibly entered her on the 9th of
February                                                                             (they never had intercourse); and that he called Mr. Hengelbrok
numerous times during the incident (he only called once—the other calls were
made by Ms.                                                                          M                                                                               . Id at 333-35.  Mr. Corbin's family treated Ms.   like a
member of the family because her own family had disowned her when she started
dating Mr. Corbin.  Id. at                                                           338.                                                                            He acknowledged that they argued, but their
arguments were no different from the kinds of arguments any couple has, until the
2-3 months leading up to the incident, when he started becoming aware of her

It took Mr. Corbin six weeks after his arrest to retrieve his computer from
Ms.                                                                                  , who was permitted to stay in their apartment with Mr. Hengelbrok, while

pertaining to or created by Ms.                                                      had been  deleted except numerous
photographs of her in flirtatious poses, belying Ms.                                 's contention that she had
suffered psychological damage and was scared of Mr. Corbin. Id. at 342; Supp.

to fold his clothes "one last time." Id. at 343-44. In her closing statement, Ms.
acknowledged having written the note. She told the Committee, "it's really
hard just to stop caring about the person, especially when something like that
happens.  Knowing he left the apartment without everything ... I felt compelled
that he needed some of his things and I did care about him at the time.                (Vol. III at

her life, Mr. Corbin referred the Committee to a February 24, 2011, article in the
Independent Florida Alligator, a local newspaper, in which Ms.                         is quoted as

polygraph examiner J. Larry Jerald administered a polygraph examination to Mr.
Corbin and submitted a report to the Committee regarding the process and results
of the test.  He received background information regarding the incident from the
GPD investigative reports and Mr. Corbin's attorney. Although Mr. Corbin
                                                                                   admitted during the pre-test interview that he and Ms.                                argued on February 9,
                                                                                   2011, he did not break into the bathroom and he did not touch Ms.                     sexually
                                                                                   against her will. This was inconsistent with Ms.                                      's reported version of the
                                                                                   incident from the police reports. Thus, the two pertinent questions that Mr. Jerald
asked Mr. Corbin were:                                                             1) On February 9th this year, against her will, did you
engage in any sex act with                                                         , and                                                                                 2) On February 9th this year, did you
physically break into                                                                                                                                                    's bathroom?   Mr. Corbin answered no to both
questions and the examiner found that no deception was indicated for either
question. The results were certified by the computerized polygraph analysis
scoring program, PolyScore.                                                        (Vol. I-A at 99.)
Beginning in                                                                       1972, Mr. Jerald served as a patrol officer, and then as a
detective for the Marion County Sheriffs Office. In that capacity, he introduced
the polygraph examination program after receiving certification as an expert. In
the thirty years he worked for the Sheriff, he supervised countless personnel,
conducted investigations for serious felonies, including child molestation, and
19

oversaw the polygraph unit. At the time he submitted his report, he had performed
over                                                                                 4,000 polygraph tests, over                           3,000 of which were examinations of sex
offenders.  He had extensive training and experience in various topics related to
sex offenders. All told his polygraph training exceeded 2,500 hours and included
training by the manufacturer of the polygraph machine. (Vol. 1-A at 99-102.)
Terry Silverman, Mr. Corbin's attorney during civil injunction proceedings
against him challenged Ms.                                                           's testimony that he had tried to bribe her to drop
the case against Mr. Corbin, among other allegations.                                (Vol. II at 302-03,                                   305,

Mr. Corbin's father, T.J. Corbin, testified that he drove up for Chase's
arraignment and saw Ms.                                                              in the hallway of the courthouse.  She embraced
him and told him she was sorry.  At that point he had not yet learned what the
charges were.                                                                        (Vol. II at                                           389-90.)  When asked if Chase has an "anger or
aggression" problem, Mr. Corbin reported that while he got angry from time to
time, like anyone, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Id. at 390-91; 403.
In his closing statement, Mr. Corbin told the committee that he hoped to
graduate with highest honors and Philosophy and Economics and that the false
allegations against him have put his life on hold. He submitted several character
letters to the Committee. The first was from ex-girlfriend Jamie Stafford, who had
20

known Mr. Corbin for six years, knew about the allegations against him, and did
not believe him capable of the acts with which he was charged.                        (Vol. I at 27.)
Similarly, current girlfriend Kayla Noel Johnston did not believe the allegations
against him were true. She found him to be a "kind, selfless, respectful, motivated
person" and noted that her father had met Mr. Corbin and very much approved of
his daughter's relationship with him. Id. at 28. Mr. Corbin is the President and
Director of the Corbin Foundation for Arts and Music, which he founded, an
organization committed to bringing the arts to local communities.  Ms. Johnson
wrote that being around Mr. Corbin makes her want to be a better person. Id.
Third, Regan Garner of the University Honors Program wrote to the
Committee that Mr.  Corbin was one of four nominees  for the nationally
competitive Harry S. Truman Scholarship. Garner worked with Mr. Corbin on the
application and informed the Committee that if the criminal charges against him
were dropped, she hoped he could be invited back to campus to continue his
studies. Id. at 26.
Finally, Dr. Denslow wrote that until the trespass was imposed, Mr. Corbin
was earning a strong A in urban economics. Dr. Denslow was his advisor on a
University Scholars project and Mr. Corbin was doing outstanding research. Dr.
Denslow offered to work with Mr. Corbin to catch up for lost time in his studies.

On December 2, 2012, the Committee recommended that Mr. Corbin be
found responsible for all three charges against him based on certain enumerated
facts.                                                                                (Vol. II at                              159.)   Neither Dean Shaw's letter concurring with the
recommendation, nor Dr. Carodine's final order denying Mr. Corbin's appeal,
contained any findings of fact. Id. at 184; Id at 186-90.
SCOPE OF JURISDICTION
This matter comes before the Court as an appeal of a final order by an
administrative agency, the University of Florida. A final order is one that "fully
disposes of the case before the lower tribunal." Morfit v. University of South
Florida, 794 So. 2d 655 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). The final order in this case is the
letter by the University's Vice President for Student Affairs affirming the Dean of
Students' decision that Mr. Corbin violated three provisions of the University of
Florida Student Code of Conduct and that sanctions, including suspension, should
be applied. See Vol. I at 183-84, 195-96.
Administrative Code Regulation                                                        6C1-4.048 of the University's Student
Honor Code and Code of Conduct provides that an internal appeal of the sort
conducted in this case constitutes final action by the University.                    (Available at

Mr. Corbin is aware of this Court's April 2012, decision holding that state
universities do not constitute administrative agencies subject to the APA as defined
by section 120.521 of the Florida Statutes. See Decker v. Univ. of W. Fla., 85 So.
3d 571 (Fla.                                                                           1st DCA 2012); see also Couchman v. Univ. of Cent. Fla., 84 So. 3d
445 (Fla. 5th DCA 2012). These decisions are in conflict with the Third District
Court of Appeal's application of the APA to University proceedings. See, e.g.,
Matar v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 944 So. 2d 1153 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006). Decker was issued
after Mr. Corbin filed his notice of appeal in the lower tribunal and the Court
appears to have accepted jurisdiction in this case based on its various orders
pertaining to extensions of time and supplementation of the record. However, in
an abundance of caution, Mr. Corbin briefly addresses the holding in Decker.
In Decker, the Court held,
The Act limits the definition of an agency to persons or entities
"acting pursuant to powers other than those derived from the
constitution." § 120.52(1), Fla. Stat. The significance of this limitation
is clear: when an officer or agency is exercising power derived from
the constitution, the resulting decision is not one that is made by an
agency as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act.
Id. at 573. The Court went on to find that the University's imposition of sanctions
against a student falls within the scope of Article IX, section 7(d) of the Florida
Constitution, which requires that the state board of governors "'operate, regulate,
23

control and be fully responsible for the management of the whole university
system,' and section 7(c), which states that each university within the system shall
be operated by a board of trustees under powers granted by the board of
governors." Id. (citations omitted). Specifically, the University was engaging in
the operation and management of the university system when it suspended Mr.
Decker. Id. Thus, it was not subject to the APA and the Court transferred the case
to the Circuit Court, ordering that Mr. Decker's notice of appeal be treated as a
petition for writ of certiorari. Id. at 572.
Mr. Corbin argues that section 120.52(1) should be construed to mean that
an entity's exercise of power derived solely from the constitution would exempt
the entity from the APA. But if the entity is acting in accordance with a more
specific statute, it is "acting pursuant to powers other than [i.e., distinct from or in
addition to] those derived from the constitution." That is, although the University
was engaging in management and operation derived from constitutional provisions
when it suspended Mr. Corbin, it was also acting pursuant to Florida statutes. See,
e.g., § 20.155, Fla. Stat. (2012) (The Board of Governors shall operate, regulate,
control, and be responsible for the management of the whole State University
System in accordance with                                                                  7, Art. IX of the State Constitution and law."). More
specifically, when implementing student conduct proceedings against Mr. Corbin,
24

the University acted pursuant to the Florida Administrative Code consisting of
regulations that it implemented pursuant to the APA. See §§ 120.536, 120.54, Fla.
Stat. To find that the application of the Code, which derives its power from the
APA, is not subject to the APA, strains any reading of Section 120.52(1).
By contrast, Mr. Corbin's reading of the provision is consistent with section
120.81                                                                                 (1)                                                                 (g) which provides, "Sections                       120.569 and   120.57 do not apply to any
proceeding in which the substantial interests of a student are determined by a state
university or a community college." This provision would serve no purpose if the
legislature intended to exempt state universities from the APA.
Finally, this Court's decision in Gopman v. Dep't of Educ., 908 So. 2d 1118
(Fla.                                                                                  1st DCA                                                             2005), which was issued after Article IX, section   7 of the
constitution was passed, cannot be squared with Decker. In Gopman, the Court
reviewed an order of the Department of Education denying eligibility for an
educational scholarship to an applicant.  On appeal, the Department argued that
section                                                                                1009.42  of the Florida Statutes should be construed as replacing
application of the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Court first stated, "The Administrative Procedure Act presumptively
governs the exercise of all authority statutorily vested in the executive branch of
state government. Gopman, 908 So. 2d at 1120 (citing § 120.50, Fla. Stat. (2003)
25

("This chapter shall not apply to: (1) The Legislature; (2) The courts.")). Just like
state universities,  the Executive Branch derives its power from Florida's
Constitution, see Art. IV, as does the Department of Education, see Art. IX, § 2.
Yet, the legislature has specifically stated that the APA presumptively governs
executive action, and this Court in Gopman held that the DOE is an administrative
agency subject to the APA for that very reason. Gopman, 908 So. 2d at 1123.
If the Decker interpretation of section 120.52(1) were applied, the exception
would surely swallow the rule. Article IV, section 6 of the Constitution provides
for the "administration of each                                                         [executive] department ... under the direct
supervision of the governor, the lieutenant governor, the governor and cabinet, a
cabinet member, or an officer or board appointed by and serving at the pleasure of
the  governor,"  with  certain  exceptions.  Under  the  Court's  analysis,  the
"administration" of any department that derives its power from this constitutional
provision—the Department of Corrections, the Department of Transportation, the
Department of Environmental Regulation—would be exempt from the APA. But
each of these departments has been deemed an administrative agency subject to the
APA and this Court has served in an appellate capacity where the administration of
those agency actions has been challenged. See, e.g., Dep't of Corrections v. Adams,
458 So. 2d 354 (Fla.                                                                    1st DCA 1984) (holding that the Department of Corrections
26

improperly failed to follow the rulemaking procedures of section                        120.54 and
thereby implicitly finding that the Department is an administrative agency subject
to the APA); Rosenzweig v. Dep't of Transportation, 979 So. 2d 1050 (Fla.               1st
DCA 2008) (treating DOT as administrative agency subject to APA); Friends of
Hatchineha, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Environmental Regulation, 580 So. 2d 267 (Fla.
1st DCA                                                                                 1991)        (treating Dep't of Environmental Regulation as administrative
agency subject to APA). See also See Griffis v. Fla. Fish & Wildlife Conservation
Comm 'n, 57 So. 3d 929 (1st DCA 2011) (reviewing Commission's power to assess
administrative penalties under APA despite the fact that the Commission's power
is derived from Article IV, section 9 of the Florida Constitution); Alpha Eta Chptr.
of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity v. Univ. of Fla., 982 So. 2d 55, 55-6 (Fla. 1st DCA
2008) (citing Art. V, § 4(b)(2), Fla. Const. and §120.68(1) & (2)(a), Fla. Stat., for
the proposition that district courts of appeal have direct review over final
administrative agency action and implicitly finding that the University of Florida is
such an agency, despite the existence of Art. IX, §7).3
3 In Decker v. Univ. of W. Fla., 85 So. 3d 571, 573 (Fla. 1st DCA 2012), the Court
noted that its decision exempting state universities from the APA was contrary to
its earlier precedent, but that these cases were either decided before Article IX,
section 7 was added to the constitution in 2002, or relied on precedent that was.
Neither exception applies to Alpha Eta Chptr. Of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity v.
Univ. of Fla.—the case was decided in 2008 and the Court relied solely on
constitutional  and  statutory provisions in concluding the university is an

For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Corbin believes this Court has jurisdiction to
hear his appeal pursuant to section 120.68 of the APA.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
An appellate court should generally uphold an administrative agency
decision if it is supported by competent, substantial evidence.  Seneca v. Fla.
Unemployment Appeals Comm 'n, 39 So.                                                   3d       385,                 387   (Fla.   1st DCA   2010).
However, the agency's application of the law is reviewed de novo. City of Coral
Gables v. Coral Gables Walter F. Stathers Mem 'I Lodge 7, Fraternal Order of
Police, 976 So. 2d 57, 63 (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (citation omitted) (holding that "[n]o
deference is due an administrative agency's error of law."). Due process requires
that an administrative proceeding be "essentially fair." See Gordon v. Savage, 383
So. 2d 646 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980).
As to the claims at issue in this case, Section                                        120.68   (7) of the Florida
Statutes provides that the appellate court must reverse the final order of an agency
when
b) the agency's action depends on any finding of fact that is not
supported by competent, substantial evidence in the record; c) The
fairness of the proceedings or the correctness of the action may have
been impaired by a material error in procedure or a failure to follow
prescribed procedure; ... e) The agency's exercise of discretion was:
(..continued)
administrative agency subject to the APA. Alpha Eta Chptr. of Pi Kappa Alpha
Fraternity, 982 So. 2d 55, 55-56 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008).

... 2. Inconsistent with agency rule[.]
Finally, an Appeal of an agency's final order may raise claims that were not
be preserved by objection. Fundamental error in civil cases is found where the
error goes to the foundation of the case or the merits of the cause of action.
Sanford v. Rubin, 237 So. 2d 134, 137 (Fla. 1970). It is present where correction is
essential to the object and purpose of the proper administration of justice. Pasco
County School Board v. Florida Public Employees Relations Commission, 353 So.
2d 108, 115 (Fla.                                                                      1st DCA 1977).
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
The University deprived Mr. Corbin of due process during conduct code
violation proceedings in four substantive ways. First, it failed to provide him with
notice of the grounds on which it charged him with off-campus conduct, nor was
competent or substantial evidence presented to permit the off-campus charges.
Second, it violated the Administrative Code by allowing the Committee to consider
the complainant's written, victim impact statement before it made its findings
regarding Mr. Corbin's responsibility.   Third, it prevented Mr. Corbin from
presenting certain character evidence to the Committee, while simultaneously
permitting Ms. Park's presentation, in both written and testimonial form, of bad
character/bad acts evidence pertaining to Mr. Corbin.  Fourth, the Committee
29

members took a prosecutorial posture with Mr. Corbin and the University's
facilitator and final decision-maker were biased against Mr. Corbin in ways that
prejudiced the proceedings.
Second, the University did not support its Order below with competent and
substantial evidence as required by law. Third, the University failed to provide a
complete record and transcription on appeal.
For all the foregoing reasons, individually and collectively, this Court must
vacate the Order below and remand for further proceedings.
ARGUMENT
I.                                                                                   MR.  CORBIN'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS WAS VIOLATED IN
THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW.
The Supreme Court has held that a student facing suspension from a public
school has property and liberty interests that require protection under the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 581
(1985). Although student disciplinary hearings do not require the same safeguards
required for criminal proceedings, Gordon v. Savage, 383 So.                         2d 646 (Fla.                                         5th
DCA 1980), rev. denied 389 So. 2d 1110 (Fla.                                         1980), due process does require
"adequate notice, an opportunity to be heard, and substantial evidence to support
the penalty." Student Alpha Id Number Guja v. School Bd. of Volusia County, 616
So. 2d 1011, 1012-1013 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993).

violated, this Court must determine whether the University violated any of its own
rules, failed to rely on competent and substantial evidence, or impaired the fairness
of the proceedings with material error.
A.                                                                                       The University Deprived Mr. Corbin of Due Process by
Failing to Give Him Notice of Which Provision of Off-
Campus Conduct he had Violated and by Failing to Find
him Responsible for Off-Campus Conduct As Defined by
Regulation                                                                               6C1-4.041, Let Alone Base Such Finding on
Competent and Substantial Evidence.
This claim was preserved below for appellate review.                                     (Vol. I at 186; Vol. I-
A at 187.)
Administrative Code Regulation                                                           6C1-4.041(2)(d)(2) of the University's
Code of Conduct permits the University to impose disciplinary action for off-
campus conduct "if it is required by law to do so, if the conduct arises from
University activities, or if the conduct poses a significant threat of undermining the
University's educational process."
Regulation                                                                               6C1-4042(6)(b)(1)(a)  provides  that  a  student  in  conduct
proceedings has a "basic right" to notice of the charges against him at least seven
business days prior to the date of the conduct hearing.
In the University's March 18, 2011, letter to Mr. Corbin informing him that
based on information from the GPD, the University was charging him with three
violations of the Code of Conduct, there is no mention of the 6C1-4.041(2)(d)(2)
32

requirements, nor the basis on which the University was charging Mr. Corbin with
off-campus conduct.                                                                    (Vol.                 1 at                                                           29-30.) The same is true for the University's
October 19, 2012, and November 8, 2011, letters to Mr. Corbin providing him
notice of his initial conduct hearing and his subsequently scheduled one. Id. at 76,
85.)
Similarly, the Student Conduct Committee Pre-Hearing Summary, which
informed the Committee of the charges it was to consider, did not include the three
conditions for pursuing off-campus conduct, nor did it instruct the Committee that
it was required to find that Mr. Corbin's conduct fell within one of the three
provisions before the Committee could make recommendations as to the conduct
violations.                                                                            (Vol.                 1-A at 111-12.) Not surprisingly, the Committee made no such
finding, nor did any of the facts found by the Committee support any of the three
conditions established in section 4.041(2)(d)(2).                                      (Vol. 1 at 159-60.)
Dean Shaw's December 15, 2011, letter approving the Committee's findings
did not address whether the conduct falls within the scope of regulation 4.041, nor
whether the University made the requisite findings of fact to meet its burden of
proof on that issue. (Vol. 1 at 183-84.)
Finally, Mr. Corbin's first claim on appeal to Assistant Vice President
Carodine alleged that charging him for off-campus conduct violated his right to
33

due process.                                                                        (Vol.                                                            1-A at                                                                           187.)  Yet, her January                                17, 2011, letter approving the
Committee's findings fails to address that claim.                                   (Vol. 1-A at 194-96.)
Thus, Mr. Corbin had no notice of which of the three off-campus conditions
were relied upon, if any, when the University charged him with misconduct.  In
short, the University violated its own regulation requiring notice and competent,
substantial evidence to support its final order, and in doing so, violated Mr.
Corbin's right to due process.  See Guerra v. State, Department of Labor &
Employment Security,                                                                427 So.2d                                                        1098,                                                                            1103                                                   (Fla.                            3d DCA   1983)          (holding

B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The University Deprived Mr. Corbin of Due Process by
                                                                                    Submitting to the Conduct Committee Ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                            's Narrative
for Consideration Before the Committee Made its Findings
of Fact, in Violation of Regulation 6C1-4.051.
This Claim was not preserved below and should be reviewed for
fundamental error.
Administrative Code Regulation 6C1-4.051(4) provides, in pertinent
part,
Alleged victims of violence whose cases are handled by the
Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution in an
administrator  or  committee  hearing  are  given  various
34

accommodations                                                                           in                                     the   conduct   process.   Victim
accommodations include:
(e) Submitting a written impact statement to the hearing
body after the finding off acts which shall be considered
during sanctioning, should the accused student be found
responsible for the violation.
(Emphasis added.)  This rule is presumably designed to prevent the Committee
from considering the impact on the victim when deciding the factual issue of
whether or not the student committed the violation(s).
In the proceedings below, the Conduct Committee was given a copy of Ms.
's Narrative, containing a lengthy impact statement, prior to the Conduct
Hearing and its members were not instructed to disregard it when determining Mr.
Corbin's responsibility for the charged violations. The Narrative contained highly
inflammatory language pertaining to Ms.                                                  's emotional state, language clearly
designed to evoke an emotional response from the Committee. See, e.g., (Vol. I at
14) ("We were together for nearly two years, during which I felt as though I was
far in too deep into the ground.  Into the ground from where I could not see
sunlight or from where I could not be heard from. But on that day, I was pulled
forth.") It also included an entire section titled, "Psychological, Social & Financial
Impact," which contained assessments that plainly should have been reserved for
after the Committee's finding regarding responsibility.  She began this section,
35

"Just like a broken plate glued back together, I will never be the same again." Id.
at 15. She then wrote that she feared for her life, was terrified at night, could not
sleep, jumped at "every little noise," Ms.                                              was staying in bed, missing classes,
sleeping as a way to "shut the world and these problems out."   She named
numerous organizations from which she had sought counseling and wrote that she
had dropped many of her academic endeavors: "Instead of partaking in any of this,
I found myself sitting in my room trying to hide from everything." Id. at 15-6.
This  victim  impact  should  have  been  confined  to  the  Committee's
consideration of Mr. Corbin's sanctions, not his responsibility.  The prejudice
stemming from such emotional outpourings cannot be overestimated and strikes at
the heart of the fundamental fairness of Mr. Corbin's proceedings, thereby
requiring a new hearing.
C.                                                                                      The Committee Was Presented With Evidence of Highly
Prejudicial   and   Inadmissible   Bad   Acts   and   Other
Accusations,   Including  Evidence  of  Unrelated   Court
Proceedings, All Im s u ning Mr. Corbin's Character and
Characterizing Ms.                                                                      as a Victim, in Violation of the
University's Own Rule.
This claim was preserved in part for review. See Vol. III at 413 (Mr.
Corbin in closing objecting to new allegations raised by Ms.                            that bore
no relevance to the issue before the Committee); Vol. II at 188-89; Vol. III
at 413.

1.                                                                                    The  University Allowed Ms.                                      to Present
Character Evidence at the Hearing Despite Its
Own  Prohibition Against Such  Evidence  and
Despite Having Prevented Mr. Corbin from Doing
So.
The University's Student Conduct Informational Meeting Checklist, which
Mr. Corbin was asked to and did sign, addresses the procedures for a Conduct
Hearing, among other things. It provides, in pertinent part, "Character witnesses
are not able to present information during a hearing but they may submit a written
statement." In accordance with this rule, Mr. Corbin submitted written statements
from a prior girlfriend, a current girlfriend, and two professors who spoke to Mr.
Corbin's character as a boyfriend and a student of integrity. See Vol. I at 25-8.
Mr. Corbin had hoped to have his girlfriend, who drove to Gainesville from West
Palm Beach, testify at the hearing, but the request was denied.                       (Vol. III at 418.)
By contrast, Ms.                                                                      was permitted to present testimony and documents
about Mr. Corbin's character, including in her closing statement so that Mr. Corbin
had no opportunity to rebut the allegations with evidence or witness testimony.
Ms.                                                                                   's  evidence went well beyond simply describing Mr.  Corbin as
untrustworthy or a bad boyfriend, it consisted of very specific instances of prior
bad acts that the University had instructed the parties, again and again, were
37

beyond the scope of the hearing, the focus of which was to be solely the February
9, 2012, incident.  See Vol. I at 73-4 (Assistant Dean Loschiavo emailing Terry
Silverman, "As far as Chase has made me aware, neither of you have knowledge of
what occurred that night, which is what the hearing is about so I don't know how
important your information will be (I'm not saying it isn't important, but I want to
emphasize that the hearing is about what occurred the night in question) it is not
about Chase's character."); Vol. II at                                                 202            (Loschiavo making it clear at the
beginning of the hearing that the focus was to be entirely on "the alleged incident"
on February 9, 2011); Id. at 209 (Chair Ascher interrupting Ms.                        's statement
and asking her to "move along to the incident itself."); Id at 233                     (Ms.
reporting that she was instructed by Loschiavo that she need not call certain
witnesses because they would offer only hearsay and character evidence rather
than evidence pertaining to the "incident on that night."); Id. at                     289            (Chair
instructing TJ Corbin to start by telling Committee what he knows about "the
incident.").   Again and again, Assistant Dean Loschiavo, who was acting as
gatekeeper for the admission of evidence throughout the entire hearing, allowed
highly inflammatory character testimony and evidence to be put before the
Committee.
38

In her opening statement, Ms.                                                          alleged that Mr. Corbin had an anger
problem and that he would sometimes just "go berserk." (Vol. II at 209.) She let it
go because she "knew why he was so angry. [She] knew his past in terms of
negative [inaudible] with his mother, his relationships with past girlfriends."4 Id.
Later she injected that she had wanted to call a friend of hers as a witness. The
friend had approached her the day before the hearing to tell her that Mr. Corbin
had had trouble with other girlfriends.  She was best friends with him in high
school and "was there for him when he was with his mental health treatments and
his past girlfriends, and he was on suicide watch."5 Id at 234.
Det. Fair testified that Ms.                                                           told her on February 9 that Mr. Corbin had
threatened and hit her in the past.                                                    (Vol. II at 281.) Fair's Supplemental Report
was given to the Committee unredacted, despite the fact that it contained a long
description of prior acts of aggression against Ms.                                    by Mr. Corbin, including
                                                                                       him hitting her, holding her by her wrists, and, on one occasion, grabbing her hand
and hitting himself with it twice.                                                     (Vol. I at 8.)
4 Similarly, Ms.                                                                       subsequently told the Committee that "his mother and
girlfriends felt like he needed somebody, and I wanted to change his perspective on
things                                                                                 [T]hat was one of the reasons I went back to him because of all the times
he would be unstable and then he felt really awful. (Vol. II at 243.)
5 Although the Chair told Ms.                                                          at that point that the information was not
particularly helpful because it was hearsay, he made clear that "if we had the
individual here that would be helpful."                                                (Vol. II at 234.) This improperly signaled
to the Committee that it could consider this type of evidence.
39

In her Narrative, Ms.                                                                    included five paragraphs detailing prior bad acts
by Mr. Corbin, all irrelevant to the incident on February 9. She described one
episode on January 14, 2011, when he woke her up enraged, and spit in her face.
When he got in his car to leave, she tried to stop him because "[h]e is notorious for
his road rage and reckless driving."                                                     (Vol. II at 16-7.)
She also describes being terrified on a camping trip with Mr. Corbin over the
winter break when he lost his temper and started swinging his knife around. She
asked him to take her home and he would not. Id. at 17. He was degrading and
would get angry at Ms.                                                                   for very small things. He made ethnic comments. Id
In her closing statement, Ms.                                                            lodged entirely new attacks on Mr.
Corbin's character using hearsay and more allegations of prior bad acts.  She
asserted that Det. Fair told Ms.                                                         how "unstable" Mr. Corbin was. Id. at 410
(much of the rest of the allegation is inaudible). For the first time she alleged that
an ex-girlfriend of Mr. Corbin's, Alexandra (last name inaudible), who "was there
for him when he was admitted to a psychiatric ward[,]" told Ms.                          that "he had
gotten her very, very drunk, to the point where he kept forcing himself on her and
eventually he had raped her.  That's why she wanted to warn me."  Ms.
alleged that another friend, when she heard about the incident, texted Ms.               to
tell her "she could not believe that Chase had done such a thing and that she was

there for me." Id. at 412.  Ms.                                                                                                                                              made several more allegations on the same
                                                                                       page, though they are so inaudible, it is impossible to recount them for the Court.
Finally, Ms.                                                                                                                                                                 was allowed to present testimony from Det. Fair telling the
Committee that Ms.                                                                     was a victim.                                                                         (Vol. II at 281) ("She basically displayed
all the signs of a classic domestic violence victim, which in belief is what she
was.).
Mr. Corbin made every effort to rebut Ms.                                              's character evidence about
him once the Committee allowed it to be presented; but he did not have the benefit
of preparation or witnesses.   When he objected to the new allegations, Mr.
Loschiavo told him they were fair game because Mr. Corbin had "brought it into
play" when his investigator discussed his ex-girlfriends. (Vol. III at 412.) This is
inaccurate.  Ms.                                                                       referenced Mr. Corbin's ex-girlfriends and his character
several times in her opening statement and in answering questions from the
Committee. See, e.g., Vol. II at 209, 234, 2543. Thus, Mr. Corbin's only option
was to present rebuttal evidence, to the extent possible, through his investigator.
His investigator's rebuttal was very general:  he had spoken with one of Mr.
Corbin's ex-girlfriends, Hannah Flynn, who told him she knew Mr. Corbin well
and that it would be completely out of character for him to behave as Ms.
41

accused him. Id. at 373, 375.
Not only did the Committee fail to curb the admission of character evidence
by Ms.                                                                                                                                                                                           it sometimes directly elicited it from witnesses. See, e.g., Vol. II at
209,                                                                                    235,                368,                                                                           390   (asking questions regarding Mr. Corbin's alleged "anger
problem"). They also asked Mr. Corbin irrelevant questions like how long he had
been with his current girlfriend.  Id. at 368.  In short, the Committee members
picked up and focused on the character evidence that Ms.                                presented despite
the University rule and Mr. Loschiavo's instruction to the contrary.
There is no evidence more inflammatory than prior bad acts evidence, which
is why the criminal courts guard its admissibility so carefully. See Thomas v. State,
599 So. 2d 158,                                                                         162 (Fla.           1st DCA 1992) (reversing conviction and stating that
because "similar fact evidence of other crimes is inherently prejudicial to a
criminal defendant's right to a fair trial, such evidence is admissible under section
90.404                                                                                  (2)                 (a) only to prove a material fact in issue, that is, a material fact that is
genuinely in dispute.");                                                                §                   90.404                                                                         (2)   (a), Fla. Stat.                                                           (precluding the admission of
character evidence to prove action in conformity with the charged act(s)). See also
Billie v. State, 863 So. 2d 323, 326-27 (Fla. 3d DCA 2003) (prohibiting admission
of evidence "submitted to show a defendant's propensity toward commission of the
offense or to show a defendant's bad character, with nothing more.").
42

None of the bad act/character evidence admitted against Mr. Corbin was
relevant to the incident on February 9, 2012, which was the only issue before the
Court.  Thus, the University violated its own rule and in doing so, rendered Mr.
Corbin's hearing irreversibly impaired as to the material issue of responsibility.
On appeal, Mr.  Corbin sought the opportunity to rebut Ms.                             's
character/bad acts evidence with newly discovered evidence, as permitted by
Regulation 6C1-4.048(2)(c)(2), but the request was denied. (Vol. I-A at 188-89.)
The University's failure to preclude the evidence at the hearing and then to further
cement the due process violation by failing to grant an appeal based on newly
discovered evidence pursuant to its own regulation robbed him of his right to due
process not once, but twice.
2.                                                                                     The  University Put Before the Committee for
Consideration                                                                          Prejudicial   Documents                        and
Testimony   Pertaining   to   Civil   Injunction
Proceedings that the University Simultaneously
Ruled Irrelevant to the Conduct Hearing.
In addition to the character evidence detailed above, the University,
seemingly on its own accord, submitted to the Committee for review Ms.                 's
Petition for Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence, which she filed
in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit on February 18, 2012.                                  (Vol. I-A at 132-36.) The
Petition contains numerous character attacks and prior bad acts that were irrelevant
43

to the incident for which Mr. Corbin was charged. See id. at 133-34. Not only is
this evidence highly inflammatory, but when Mr. Corbin attempted to ask
questions of Ms.                                                                       about the injunction, Mr. Loschiavo cut him off and stated,
"We're going to move on because the injunction and the issues of the injunction are
not really what we're here to talk about."                                             (Vol. II at 265.) The inclusion of highly
inflammatory and irrelevant evidence in the record is inexplicable, and Mr.
Loschiavo's further decision to prevent Mr. Corbin from asking Ms.                     about it
constitutes a due process violation.
In sum, the improper admission by Ms.                                                  of character evidence,
including evidence of prior bad acts, combined with Dean Loschiavo's limitations
on the admission of such evidence by Mr. Corbin, violated his due process right
and materially impaired the fairness of the proceedings below.
D.                                                                                     The Chair and Faculty Member of the Conduct Committee,
the Director of Student Conflict and Resolution, and the
Dean of Students Were Biased Against Mr. Corbin in
violation of his Right to Due Process.
In Regulation 6C1-4.042(6)(a) the Board of Regents makes clear that "[t]he
purpose and context of the student conduct process and sanctions imposed,
including but not limited to reviews and hearings hereunder, are educational and
not adversarial in nature." (Emphasis added.) The administrative agency's role is to
act as facilitator without an interest in any particular outcome. Thus, by its own
44

rule, the University prohibits the agency from acting as prosecutor, even an
impartial one. Yet, members of the Committee took a prosecutorial posture when
asking Mr. Corbin questions, which it did not take with Ms.                          . Moreover, the
Hearing facilitator, Chris Loschiavo, and the Dean of Students, who was
responsible for determining if Mr. Corbin was responsible for the charged conduct
and issuing a sanction, both displayed evidence of bias against Mr. Corbin.
Accordingly, his right to due process was violated.
1.                                                                                   The Chair and Faculty Members of the Conduct
Committee Acted as Prosecutors and Improperly
Accepted Ms.                                                                         's Evidence as True on Behalf
of the Committee Even Before the Hearing Had
Concluded
This claim was not preserved below.
The record below demonstrates that some of the Committee members were
biased against Mr. Corbin before they even heard all of the • evidence and,
accordingly, acted as prosecutors rather than fair arbiters.  The evidence of this
takes two forms: First, members of the Committee asked questions of Mr. Corbin
in an accusatory tone or used their questions to make points about the evidence.
Second, on a couple of occasions, a member stated, for all other members to hear,
that the Committee was accepting Ms.                                                 's version of the events, even before all
of the evidence had been presented. Most often, these questions and statements
45

were made by the only two non-students on the committee—Chair Eric Ascher and
faculty member Dana Myers.
As to the first category, one member asked Mr. Corbin about the hole in the
bottom of the bathroom door, which Mr. Corbin described as "very small." Ms.
Myers responded, "I've actually seen the pictures and that actually doesn't look
like minor cosmetic damage whatsoever in my opinion."                              (Vol. II at 323) When
Mr. Corbin conceded that he kicked the door, Ms. Myers added, "That sure sounds
angry." Id. at 326.  Following some back-and-forth on the size of the hole, the
Chair stated, "Well, but the point I think we're making is ...                     [g]ranted it's a thin
piece of wood, but you ... still would have had to exert some degree of force to
make a hole in the door. Id at 325 (emphasis added).
Regarding the note Ms.                                                             sent Mr. Corbin when she packed his
belongings, which the Committee apparently was not given, Mr. Corbin told the
Committee he thought it unlikely that a victim would "send handwritten notes
about how bad they want to fold your laundry one last time."   Ms. Myers
responded, sarcastically, "Are you an extensive expert on victim behaviors?"       (Vol.
II at 370.)
The second category of bias was demonstrated when the Chair asked Mr.
Corbin a question submitted by Ms.                                                 and simultaneously commented on the
46

reliability of the evidence pertaining to a critical issue in dispute: "On that same
morning when                                                                           went to take a shower, she locked the bathroom door—we've
already established that this happened"                                                (Vol. II at 352) (emphasis added).
Similarly, the Committee asked Mr. Corbin whether he was at the Southwest
Recreation Center on February 8, 2011, as Ms.                                          alleged because she believed
him to be following her. Mr. Corbin responded that he did not know, but that he
works out there. The Chair responded, "Her story that you were there, we'll accept
that." Id. at 323.  Later, when investigator Mike Thompson was presenting the
Committee with a snapshot of the evidence he considered and reported that there
was some damage to one of the doors, but that it was the bedroom door, not the
bathroom door, the Chair responded, "No, we pretty much know that it was a
bathroom door."                                                                        (Vol. II at 377.)
These comments and questions not only indicate a bias in favor of Ms.
and an unwillingness to consider all of the evidence before forming a conclusion
about Mr. Corbin's responsibility, they also carried particular weight because they
were offered by the only two non-student members of the Committee—the Chair
and Ms. Myers.6
6 Ms. Myers' background is in mental health counseling and, specifically,
crisis intervention, http://www.arts.uftedu/bio.aspx?PID=253, so her assessment
likely would have been given even more weight by the student members of the

2.                                                                                       The Director of Student Conflict and Resolution
and the Dean of Students Were Biased Against Mr.
Corbin and Should Have Recused Themselves from
Participation in His Proceedings.
This claim was preserved below in part.                                                  (Vol. I-A at                                                      187)   (asserting in
Appeal Request that Mr. Loschiavo's refusal to ask all of Mr. Corbin's questions
of the witnesses violated his right to due process); see also Vol. II at 244-5, 265-66
(Corbin's specific objections to refusals to ask questions). The remaining portion
of the claim that internal University emails reveal Assistant Dean Loschiavo's and
Dean Shaw's bias against Mr. Corbin, relies on emails that were produced after the
proceedings below and are included in the Amended Record on Appeal. Because
Mr. Corbin had no way to know of their existence, and therefore no ability to raise
the claim below, he has not waived it for review by this Court, nor should the
claim be reviewed only for fundamental error.
Section                                                                                  120.665 of the Florida Statutes provides that an administrative
agency head may be disqualified for bias, prejudice, or interest. Charlotte County
v. IMC-Phosphates Co., 824 So. 2d 298, 300-01 (Fla.                                      1st DCA 2002) (reversing
final order of Superintendant of EPA where he made a statement in public, prior to
reviewing the appeal, lauding the decision of the administrative law judge below).
The test for determining bias worthy of recusal is "whether the facts alleged would

prompt a reasonably prudent person to fear that they will not obtain a fair and
impartial hearing." Id. at                                                                 300                                                                     (citation omitted).  This Court also has applied
another standard, first enunciated in Bay Bank & Trust Co. v. Lewis, 634 So. 2d
672 (Fla.                                                                                  1st DCA 1994), requiring that the movant demonstrate "just cause" for
the removal of an agency head, as distinct from the standard used for removal of a
judge. See also § 120.665, Fla. Stat.
To be sure, an agency head may wear several hats: she may serve as
investigator, prosecutor and adjudicator in the same matter.  As this Court has
made clear, "this blending of roles does not, in and of itself, create an
unconstitutional risk of bias." Bay Bank & Trust,                                          634 So.                                                                 2d at 675                                          (citations
omitted). That said, the decision maker in an administrative proceeding must, at a
minimum, be impartial to satisfy the standard for due process. Id (citing Cherry
Communications, Inc. v. Deason, 652 So. 2d 803, 804-805 (Fla.                              1995)). And, as
noted above, the University of Florida requires an even higher standard than the
courts for the agency representative's impartiality. Fla. Admin. Code R.                   6C1-
4.042                                                                                      (6)                                                                     (a)                                                ("The purpose and context of the student conduct process and
sanctions imposed, including but not limited to reviews and hearings hereunder,
are educational and not adversarial in nature.")                                           (emphasis added). The agency
representative's role at the hearing, filled in this case by Mr. Loschiavo, is to act as
49

facilitator without an interest in any particular outcome.  Neither Assistant Dean
Loschiavo, the Hearing facilitator, nor Dean Shaw, who rendered the decision
finding Mr. Corbin responsible for the charges,' conducted themselves in this
manner.
a.                                                                                   Based on Internal University Emails,
Mr. Corbin has Both the Belief of a
Reasonably Prudent Person that He
Did not Receive a Fair and Impartial
Hearing and Just Cause for Vacating
the                                                                                  Final                                                      Order   Below   and
Remanding for New Proceedings.
The aforementioned bias and prejudice are demonstrated first by several
internal University emails between Mr. Loschiavo and Dean Shaw. Email
correspondence between them dated October 19, 2011, responding to a request for
a continuance from Mr. Corbin's attorney, Terry Silverman, so that ,both he and
Mr. Corbin's father could attend the conduct hearing, reads as follows:
LOSCHIAVO                                                                            This is what we are dealing with on this case. They are
getting on my last nerve, which isn't smart given I am
hearing the case.
SHAW                                                                                 I'm sorry — I know they are trying. I just had to have a
long conversation with our General Counsel regarding
the student with Larry last week. Help any knowing you
aren't the only one? :)

shall review the recommendation of the Conduct Committee and render the
decision regarding the accused's guilt and sanctions.

written to Dave once. We literally just sent the hearing

dad and attorney available although they both don't get to
come anyway, do they?
LOSCHIAVO                                                                               They are serving as witnesses not advisors, apiairitly
they have had some direct interactions with                                             . I
remain a bit skeptical of this however ,but that is what
Chase is telling me. I am trying to out fair him. We'll see
how that works out.
(Vol. I at 66-70) (emphasis added). This exchange demonstrates an intention by
Mr. Loschiavo to penalize Mr. Corbin for requesting continuances, a skepticism
about Mr. Corbin's veracity, and evidence that Mr. Losciavo assumed an
adversarial role against Mr. Corbin by trying to "out fair" him. See also id. at 73-4
(telling Mr. Corbin's attorney he's not sure how important his and Mr. Corbin's
father's testimony will be).
On December                                                                             7,                                                         2012, Dean Shaw received an email from Mandy
Hambelton, Assistant Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution,
informing Dean Shaw that Ms. Hambelton had provided the voicemails Mr. Corbin
left on Michael Hengelbrok's phone, "for your listening pleasure." Dean Shaw
then wrote to Mr. Loschiavo after accessing them: "Went and listened to some of
51

his closing statement. 'I've never been a violent person.' Hello-voice mail?!" Mr.
Loschiavo then wrote back that the comment "[m]ade me laugh."                             (Vol.                                1-A at
180-82.) This exchange demonstrates that neither Dean Shaw nor Mr. Loschiavo
treated the proceedings with the seriousness they deserved, mocking Mr. Corbin in
a manner that confirms their adversarial posture against him.8
b.                                                                                        Assistant   Dean  Loschiavo   Made
Numerous Decisions Regarding the
Evidence  that  Indicated  A  Bias
Against Mr.  Corbin and Deprived
Him of Due Process.
During the Conduct Hearing, Mr. Loschiavo made evidentiary decisions that
disadvantaged Mr. Corbin and seemed to have no rational basis. For example, Mr.
Loschiavo, of his own accord, following a long discussion during investigator
Mike Thompson's testimony regarding whether Mr. Corbin was accusing Officer
Armstrong of filing a false police report, instructed that the police reports be
admitted into evidence for the Committee's reference, though the reason is
8 The appropriate avenue for addressing such bias or prejudice would
normally be to file a motion to recuse the offending administrator and, if denied, to
file an interlocutory Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the District Court of Appeal.
See Charlotte County v. IMC-Phosphates Co.,                                               824 So.                              2d 298 (Fla.   1st DCA
2002). But because Mr. Corbin only learned of the emails on appeal while working
with the University's Clerk to compile the Amended Record, his only recourse
now is to respectfully request that the Court reverse the lower tribunal's final order
and remand for a new hearing based on a reasonable belief that he did not receive a
fair and impartial hearing or appeal.

inaudible.                                                                             (Vol. II at 380-82.)
Yet, Mr. Corbin sought to introduce through investigator Mike Thompson a
note that Ms.                                                                          left for him when she packed his clothes, stating that she wanted
to fold his clothes one last time, and enclosing in the suitcase only items she had
given him. Id. at 343-44. When asked why he did not submit the note in advance,
he told the Committee he did, but that he did not realize it was not legible. Id at
369-70. The record bears out that he did in fact send the note to the University via
email.                                                                                 (Vol. I-A at 37.) Despite the obvious relevance of the note, the Committee
members' interest in it as evidenced by numerous questions about it, id. at 345-46,
and Ms.                                                                                's admission that she wrote it to Mr. Corbin, Vol. II at 360, Mr.
Loschiavo refused to let Mr. Corbin admit it for the Committee's review.               (Vol. II
at 370.)
Mr. Loschiavo and the Chair of the Committee also prevented Mr. Corbin
from asking several relevant questions of the witnesses. Administrative Code Rule
4.042                                                                                  (7)                                                                          (a) provides, "The charged student ... shall have the right ...   (iii) to
present questions to be asked of any witness who is present at the hearing by the
administrator conducting the hearing or the chair of the hearing body." By limiting
Mr. Corbin's questions, the University violated this regulation and deprived him of
due process, further evidence of Mr. Loschiavo's bias against him.
53

Mr. Corbin submitted                                                                  67 questions to be asked of Ms.                                        when she
testified.                                                                            (Vol. I-A at 167-171.) Mr. Loschiavo and/or the Chair9 prevented him
from asking or reworded 15 of those. The most prejudicial are as follows. First,
Mr. Corbin wanted to ask Ms.                                                          if he had provided all of the furniture in their
shared apartment. (Vol. I-A at 167, Question 6.) With this question he intended to
shed doubt on Ms.                                                                     's claim that for two months leading up to the incident, she
and Mr. Corbin were no longer romantically involved and he had been sleeping on
the couch in the living room, while she slept in the bedroom. (Vol. II at 244-45.)
Mr. Loschiavo, having asked why the question was relevant, responded to Mr.
Corbin's explanation, "I'm just asking [inaudible], I don't know. You can say that
in your statement, but we don't need to ask questions about that." Id at 245.
The Chair subsequently skipped question 25: "Do you have a recollection of
me making arrangements for you to travel to meet my family in the state of
Minnesota?" and 26: "Do you agree that during our relationship we discussed
plans for marriage?"                                                                  (Vol. I at                                                             168.)  He also skipped question 29: "When you
arrived at the apartment [the day of the incident] do you have a recollection of me
having prepared a poem to deliver to you as well as other gifts to commemorate
9 The record gives some indication that one of Mr. Loschiavo's roles at the
hearing was to vet the questions from each party before giving them to the Chair to
ask; thus, even when Mr. Loschiavo is not explicitly on the record rejecting some
of the omitted questions, he has likely done so on behalf of the Chair.
54

our 18th month anniversary?"10 Id. These were all designed to rebut Ms.
contention that she and Mr. Corbin had broken up two months prior to the alleged
incident.
Next, the Chair changed the language of Mr. Corbin's                                     46th question,
"Specifically, did you take photographs of yourself and leave them on the
computer for me to locate once it was returned to me?"  Id. at                           169                               (emphasis
added). The Chair instead asked: "[D]id you retain his computer" and use it to
store photographs of yourself on the computer?"                                          (Vol. II at 259-60.) Ms.          left
numerous photographs on Mr. Corbin's computer that can only be described as
provocative. See Supp. Rec. at 426-27, 432-42. Mr. Corbin certainly had the right
to establish for the Committee that she left them there for him to find, thus
demonstrating either that she still had affection for him after alleging he raped her,
or, at the very least, wanted to taunt him. Either way, the photos call into question
not only her testimony about the incident, but also her testimony about how
devastated and withdrawn she was after the incident.
m Although Ms.                                                                           had already testified about the   =                     , the gifts were not
mentioned and Mr. Corbin had a right to clarify with Ms. I                               M                                 whether these items
indicated that he was under the belief that they were still romantically involved on
February 9, 2011.
" This portion of the question is taken from Questions 44-5 asking Ms.
whether she retained and used Mr. Corbin's computer over a period of days and
weeks when his attorney was trying to recover it for Mr. Corbin. (Vol. 2 at 169.)
Thus, Mr. Corbin does not object to it.
55

Mr. Corbin wanted to ask Ms.                                                       if she was aware of the polygraph test
that he took (Vol. II at                                                           170, Question 51; Vol. I-A at 97-98) and Mr. Loschiavo
stated, for no apparent reason, "We're not asking questions about the polygraph.
You'll have a chance to address that in your statement." (Vol. II at 263.)
Perhaps  the  most  egregious  example,  because  it  demonstrates  the
Committee's rewriting of Mr. Corbin's questions and because the answer and the
objection are so inaudible that prejudice cannot be assessed, is as follows:
COMMITTEE CHAIR:  Can you describe-this is, again, a question from
Chase, can you describe-although we've rephrased
it a little bit, quite a bit-can you describe for us
some of the communications that you had with
Terry   Silverman,   Chase's   attorney   in   the
injunction, and I guess what were some of the
things that went back and forth between you and
him? Did you ever make any accusations against
him, that kind of thing? Can you talk about that a
little bit?
Yes, there were several times he would try to pull
me aside and ask to talk to me privately. I have
never spoken to him privately other than through
email. I would never compose a message on my
own and send an email. It was either [inaudible]
through Terry [inaudible] from my [inaudible] so I
responded. Other than that, I never accused him of
anything. Again, all the [inaudible] email that he
sends Zach. I guess through the [inaudible] wanted
to push back the [inaudible] hearings knowing that
I wasn't going to be home during the summer for
an opportunity that I could not pass up, which is
[inaudible]. The thing is I was so glad to get away.
56

Secondly, the email [inaudible] told me [inaudible]
email                                                                                [inaudible]  that  Terry                                    [inaudible]  front
bumper [inaudible] wanted everything to be over
and done with, and I didn't want to keep it going.
So in order for me to receive the money that he put
damages on my car [inaudible] driving it on the
[inaudible].                                                                         [Inaudible], but I had to either not
show up at the hearing at all; the Student Conduct
Hearing at all or if I did show up I specifically had
to say that Chase Corbin is not a threat to the
University of Florida. That was exactly [inaudible]
from me.
COMM:1111,E CHAIR:  Okay.
LASCHIAVO:                                                                           You can't address [inaudible].
CORBIN:                                                                              I would like to state an objection to the refusal to
ask [inaudible].
LASCHIAVO:                                                                           You can explain that.
(Vol. II at 265-66.) The one question asked by the Chair above was a compilation
of three questions submitted by Mr. Corbin: 1) "Did you at some time early in this
case accuse my lawyer, Terry Silverman, of attempting to bribe you and pay you to
drop the charges?"                                                                   2) Did you advise the administration at the University of
Florida that my lawyer was attempting to bribe you?" and 3) "Did you withdraw
your allegations against Mr. Silverman and advise the university that, in fact, he
did not ever attempt to bribe you?" The last question was never asked by the
Committee, the only one that specifically would have called into question Ms.
57

's credibility, not just as to the allegations against Mr. Silverman, but as to the
accuracy of any of her testimony, reports to the police and Narrative.
Finally,  Mr.  Loschiavo omitted questions                                             60-67  over Mr.  Corbin's
objection, id. at 266. These questions pertained to court proceedings in which Ms.
sought a preliminary injunction against Mr. Corbin. Among other things, he
sought to elicit the fact that Ms.                                                     did not produce any corroborating evidence
to substantiate her claim that he violated the injunction. Despite the fact that Ms.
's accusations from the Petition for Injunction were in the record, Mr.
Loschiavo cut off Mr. Corbin's line of questioning, stating, "the injunction and the
issues of the injunction are not really what we're here to talk about."                (Vol. II at
265.) Thus, the Committee had only the ruling in favor of an injunction and no
insight into how weak the evidence was that supported it.
The relevance of the aforementioned questions is clear, much of it going to
the central issue at the hearing—Ms.                                                   's credibility. Because this case rested on
a finding by the Committee that Ms.                                                    was more consistent and more believable
than Mr. Corbin, such omissions constituted a violation of Mr. Corbin's right to
due process and of the University's own regulation, thereby requiring reversal even
if the Court fails to find bias on Mr. Loschiavo's part.
58

II.                                                                                 THE UNIVERSITY BASED ITS ORDER ON FINDINGS OF FACT
THAT   WERE   NOT   SUPPORTED   BY   COMPETENT   AND
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
Regulation 6C1-4.042(8) provides that student conduct proceedings "shall
be based upon a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard
Information                                                                         (including hearsay) that supports factual findings required for the
ultimate decision ... shall be the kind of information upon which reasonable,
prudent persons would rely in the conduct of their affairs." Specifically, the
agency's ruling must be supported by competent and substantial evidence.
Seneca v. Fla. Unemployment Appeals Comm 'n, 39 So. 3d 385, 387 (Fla. 1st DCA
2010).
In the case at bar, the Order below did not meet this burden as to its finding
of responsibility for sexual assault and sexual misconduct. On those two charges,
the Conduct Committee found the following facts to support its recommendation:
4                                                                                   (b)1                                                                  - Initial report by victim filed indicated non consensual sex[;]
- inconsisteny [sic] in story by accused[;]
- more detailed account from victim including pushed him away
and said NO[;]
- actions such as forcin: himself into bathroom; angered
comments toward                                                                     & Michael both before & after
incident[;]
4                                                                                   (b)2 — implicit by being responsible for 4(b)1[.]
(Vol. I-A at 159.)
59

It is noteworthy that the same facts were used to support findings of
responsibility for Regulation 6C1-4.041(4)(b)(1) and for (b)(2). This immediately
calls into question whether the University's intent was to punish Mr. Corbin for as
many acts as possible, regardless of whether each charge involved different facts.
Whether or not that was the intent, it was the effect.  Although the concept of
"double jeopardy" is not applied in agency proceedings, the double charges here
seem to violate the spirit, if not the letter, of University Regulation                  6C1-
4.041                                                                                    (2)                                                          (d)(1), which addresses off-campus conduct: ". . . [T]he conduct authority
of the University will not be used merely to duplicate the penalty imposed for such
an act under applicable ordinances and laws."  While it would have been difficult
for the University initially to judge whether the same evidence would be used to
support each charge, once the Committee indicated as much, the University should
only have found Mr. Corbin responsible and punished him for one of the two
charges.
Further, the facts on which the Committee relied do not meet the "competent
and substantial evidence" test.  Most significantly, the Committee found Mr.
Corbin's descriptions of the incident to be inconsistent and Ms.                         's to be more
detailed, Vol. I-A at 159, the implication being that her report was not inconsistent.
To be sure, Ms.                                                                          was consistent in claiming that Mr. Corbin had touched her
60

against her will, but her credibility on that point is very much called into question
by the utter inconsistency on specifics she provided in police reports, her
Narrative, and then at the Hearing.
To Cpl. Armstrong, Ms.                                                                  stated that when Mr. Corbin entered the
bathroom, she simply got out of the shower, told him to leave her alone, and then
got back into the shower.  Mr. Corbin disrobed and entered the shower. Despite
her repeated requests that he leave, he "forcibly penetrated her vagina with his
penis."                                                                                 (Vol. I at 1-a; Vol. II at 280.) At that point, "she no longer had the energy
to defend herself."                                                                     (Vol. I at 1-a.) Mr. Corbin was inside her only a few seconds
and did not ejaculate. Id.
She told Det. Fair that once in the shower, Mr. Corbin pushed her up against
the wall and penetrated her "a few times."                                              (Vol. I at 7-8.) In her Narrative, she
wrote that Mr. Corbin had only "tried to enter" her. Id at 14.
Ms.                                                                                     's testimony to the Committee, given ten months after the incident,
was significantly more detailed. She asserted that when she got out of the shower
to confront Mr. Corbin, they had a struggle over her phone.                             (Vol. II at 218) ("... I
was trying to get my phone from him again so [inaudible] he would either hold it
above my head and slap my arms down, or [inaudible] trying to get it from him.").
She also mentioned for the first time that Mr. Corbin was kissing her all over her
61

neck in the shower with her back towards the wall. When she moved away from
him, he turned her around and entered her. Then, "[h]e turned me around again
after that and that's when [inaudible] and he was kissing me all over." Id at 217-
18. At that point, she was able to push him away. Id. at 218-19; compare Vol. I at
1-a (he penetrated her and she no longer had the energy to defend herself); Vol. II
at                                                                                      299 (Det. Fair testifying that Ms.                                    had not struggled at all once in the
shower: "she was too tired to fight him and she just basically stood there.").
Regarding the incidents after the shower, Ms.                                           's accounts differ as well.
In her report to Det. Fair, she stated that when they both got out of the shower, she
ran to the bedroom closet and Mr. Corbin followed her. Id. at 8. In her Narrative,
she hurried to the closet to get dressed when he left her alone in the bathroom.
(Vol. I at 14-5.)
She told Det. Fair Mr. Corbin pushed her down in the closet and kissed and
sucked on her neck.  She then crawled to the living room, at which time Mr.
Corbin ripped the poem he had written for her. He then threatened to kill himself
with a rope and held up a KA-Bar knife.                                                 (Vol. I at 8.) In her Narrative, however,
Ms.                                                                                     describes another detailed struggle over her phone during which Mr.
Corbin kept calling Mr. Hengelbrok.  He would not let her out of the closet.
Despite her screaming to stop, he hovered over her and held her on the ground, left
62

her there and came back with two different ropes, one short and one heavy. Then
he left the closet, went to the living room and climbed up to their loft where he tied
the heavier rope around a podium and threatened to kill himself. She followed him
into the living room. Their argument lasted a few hours.                                 (Vol. I at 15.)
In a third version, Ms.                                                                  told the Committee that Mr. Corbin went in and
out of the closet three times, each time bringing back a different rope, the first a
short one, the second a longer one and the last the heavy one. He tied the second
rope around his neck and asked if she wanted him to commit suicide—he pulled
the rope so hard it snapped off his neck.                                                (Vol. II at 220-22.) Despite his absence
when he left to get each rope, Ms.                                                       apparently never attempted to get out of the
closet when he was gone.
It was the third rope that he tied to the podium and threatened to hang
himself with—she had followed him into the living room to see what he was going
to do. Again, despite his being upstairs in the loft, she made no effort to escape.
She eventually fell to the ground and he held her until the police came. Id. at 222-
23.
There are numerous other inconsistencies in Ms.                                          's reports, Narrative
and testimony, including the utter lack of evidence that Mr. Corbin busted open the
door to the bathroom. Vol. II at 285 (Det. Fair's testimony there was no sawdust
63

or wood chips under the bathroom door); Vol. I at 48; Supp. Rec. at 428 (pictures
showing that neither the lock nor the frame of the bathroom door were disturbed in
any way).
By contrast, Mr. Corbin was consistent in his reporting on the incident both
to his father, on recorded jail calls, and to the Committee. He kicked the bathroom
door out of anger and Ms.                                                                  opened it. He called her a whore and asked whom
she had been sleeping with, at which time she pulled him into the shower and
seduced him. He did not enter her because he was not aroused. They continued
arguing after they got out of the shower and Mr. Corbin tried to leave. Ms.
blocked his exit and the police came shortly thereafter.                                   (Vol. I at                                         11-12
(description of events to father during jail call); Vol. II at 313-14, 324 (statement to
Committee).  He admitted to leaving an angry message on Mr. Hengelbrok's
phone, but asserted that Ms.                                                               made the other calls in an effort to set him up.
(Vol. II at 334.)
To be sure, in his Case Supplemental Report, Cpl. Armstrong claimed that
Mr. Corbin gave him a statement which is inconsistent in two respects with Mr.
Corbin's testimony before the Committee and his phone calls to his father. He
allegedly indicated to Armstrong that he went into the bathroom to check on Ms.
because she had fainted in the shower. After she pulled him into the shower,
64

they had consensual sex. (Vol. I at                                                    1-a.)  After Mr. Corbin gave his statement,
Armstrong asked Officer Hinson to read Mr. Corbin his Miranda rights. Id. at 2.
However, there are vast inconsistencies among the three reporting officers
about this alleged statement, the most important of which is Det. Fair's testimony
to the Committee that she and Det. Young did not go speak to Mr. Corbin because
he had invoked his right to an attorney/silence. This calls into question not only
Cpl. Armstrong's report, but also Det. Young's report that she did go speak to Mr.
Corbin, apparently at Cpl. Armstrong's instruction, despite Armstrong having
heard Mr. Corbin invoke his rights. Id. at 1-a — 6; Vol. 2 at 281.
Det. Young's and Cpl. Armstrong's contention that Mr. Corbin made a
statement is either highly unlikely or constituted a violation of Mr. Corbin's Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination. Whichever the case, the Committee's
contention that Ms.                                                                    's version of events was more reliable than Mr. Corbin's
because of its consistency and detail is belied by the record. The more detailed her
portrayal became, the more inconsistent it became.
As to the other specific findings of fact by the Committee, they, too, are
unsupported. First, the Committee found that Ms.                                       pushed Mr. Corbin away
and said NO. As explained above, she reported pushing him away on one occasion
and giving in because she did not have the energy on another.
65

Second, the Committee found compelling the fact that her initial report
indicated non-consensual sex. While that may be the case, her initial report is the
one that left out significant details and contradicted the Committee's other finding
that she pushed Mr. Corbin away.                                                       (Vol. I at                                                                  1-a)   (report that                told Cpl.
                                                                                       Armstrong she did not have the strength to defend herself).  Further, Ms.                                      's
Narrative contradicts the finding because it states only that Mr. Corbin "tried" to
enter her. Id, at 14.
As to the Committee's finding that Mr. Corbin broke into the bathroom, this
finding is called into question by the physical evidence—specifically, the pictures
of the bathroom door, which show no evidence the frame or lock were damaged.
While Mr. Corbin certainly admitted saying terrible things to Ms.                      and
Mr. Hengelbrok, that cannot alone support the Committee's recommendation.
Neither the Dean of Students nor the Vice President for Student Affairs made any
findings of facts in their orders.                                                     (Vol. I-A at                                                                184,   195-6.)  Accordingly, the
University failed to meet its burden of proof in finding Mr. Corbin responsible for
a violations of Regulation 6C1-4.041(4)(b)(1) and (2).
III.                                                                                   MR. CORBIN HAS BEEN DENIED DUE PROCESS BECAUSE THE
UNIVERSITY FAILED TO AUDIBLY RECORD HIS HEARING
AND NEITHER PARTY CAN PROVIDE A RECORD THAT IS
BOTH COMPLETE AND ACCURATE ON APPEAL.
66

A.                                                                                     A Defendant is Entitled to a New Proceeding When the
Record on Appeal is Incomplete, the Record Cannot Be
Reconstructed, the Incomplete Portions Are Necessary for
Thoughtful Review on Appeal, and the Defendant Can
Demonstrate  that They Prejudiced  his  Presentation of
Claims.
In the case at bar, to the extent this Court may find that he has not
demonstrated prejudice, Mr. Corbin's right to an appeal has been compromised
through no fault of his own because the transcript of the hearing is rife with
inaudible portions and the record is otherwise incomplete.
Where a complete transcript of lower tribunal proceedings is unavailable on
appeal and the omitted portions are necessary for the appellate court's review of
the proceedings, the court has no choice but to vacate the disposition and remand
for a new trial. Delap v. State, 350 So. 2d 462, 463 (Fla. 1977); see also Lipman v.
State, 428 So.2d 733 (Fla. 1st DCA 1983) (where portions of transcript are missing
through no fault of defendant and those portions are necessary for court's complete
review of issues raised on appeal, the court "is compelled to reverse ... and remand
for a new trial."); Jones v. State, 780 So. 2d 218, 219 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001).
In HCT v. State, 662 So.2d                                                             1034 (Fla.                                             1st DCA   1995), the appeal of a
juvenile proceeding, this Court vacated the defendant's conviction where the court
reporting equipment malfunctioned and a transcript could not be reconstructed by
the parties. Similarly, in Johnson v. State, 442 So. 2d 193 (Fla. 1983), the Supreme
67

Court remanded to the trial court so the parties could attempt to reconstruct a
record on appeal that "was discovered to be virtually incomprehensible because of
omissions, ... misspellings, and obvious inaccuracies in either the recording or the
transcription of the trial."                                                             Johnson,                                        442 So.   2d at   195. The parties and
stenographer were able to reconstruct the record and the trial court found the
corrected transcripts contained "no significant or material fault . . . [nor] even one
prejudicial omission or error." Id. On appeal, the court refused to vacate the
Defendant's conviction because he was "unable to point to any omission,
inconsistency or inaccuracy which prejudice[d] the presentation of his case. Id.;
see also, White v. State of Fla. Dept. of Corr., 939 F.2d 912, 914 (11th Cir. 1991)
(appeal denied where defendant could not prove defect in transcripts caused undue
prejudice); Darling v. State, 808 So. 2d 145, 163 (Fla. 2002) (same).
Thus, the operative questions when a transcript on appeal is incomplete is
whether the missing portions are necessary for the court's complete review of the
claims  on  appeal  and  whether  the  omissions  prejudiced  the  defendant's
presentation of his claims.
B.                                                                                       The Amended Record on Appeal Is So Incomplete
and Inaccurate that the Court Cannot Complete a
Full  Review  of Mr.  Corbin's  Claims  and  His
Presentation of Those Claims Has Been Compromised
Such that the Court Must Vacate the Final Order
Below and Remand for a New Hearing.
68

Mr. Corbin's Student Conduct hearing below was audio recorded pursuant to
Regulation 6C1-4.042(7)(b).                                                            appeared by speaker phone. (Vol. II at
202, 205.) The first version of the Record on Appeal provided by the University's
Clerk was completely unintelligible for various reasons. At Mr. Corbin's request,
the Clerk commissioned a more professional transcription, the one now contained
in the Amended Record on Appeal. Counsel for the parties had several email
exchanges in an effort to ensure that the record is complete and accurate for the
Court's review. The remaining omissions could not be rectified by either party.
Thus, as reported in the Joint Stipulation Regarding Record on Appeal, filed with
the Court on September 12, 2012, "the parties agree that the transcription provided
for the Court is the most complete transcription that they can collectively provide
for review on appeal. (Joint Stipulation at 1-2.) There remain numerous inaudible
portions or portions not transcribed accurately. In addition, several documents are
missing from the Record. To the extent the Court may find the record so lacking
that it cannot accurately assess Mr. Corbin's claims, it must remand this case for a
new hearing below.
1.                                                                                     Significant portions of Ms.              's Testimony Are
Inaudible or Unintelligable.
The most troubling inadequacy of the Amended Record on Appeal is that
69

significant portions of the testimony are reported as "inaudible" or make so little
sense that they must be inaccurately transcribed. See, e.g.,                          (Vol. II at 372) ("A
Committee member's question was transcribed as, "Relevant was the word the
State Attorney used when [inaudible] case?").  The word "inaudible" is littered
throughout Ms.                                                                        's statements and testimony 270 times. For example, in her
opening statement, Ms.                                                                testified,
Yes,                                                                                  [inaudible]. So I'm fast forwarding to we moved in
together in August. I hadn't wanted to live with him, but again that's
where I was going because I didn't have anybody and I didn't want to
live with him [inaudible], but I did not want to be with him.
(Vol. II at 208.) Her description of the incident for which Mr. Corbin was charged
is equally unintelligable:
I just jumped out of the shower trying to get the phone from
him because if he kept looking through my phone it was going to
anger him more [inaudible] intimate...: When I jumped out of the
shower I went right to him. He had left the bathroom door and then I
was trying to get my phone from him again so [inaudible] he would
either hold it above my head and slap my arms down, or [inaudible]
trying to get it from him                                                             I jumped back into the shower, I walked
into the bathroom, was about to lock the bathroom door. I got into the
shower and I couldn't lock and shut the bathroom door. He followed
in after me                                                                           Then when he pushed me against the wall [inaudible]
the other side [inaudible] push, I asked him to stop and I pushed him
away. Eventually [inaudible] I just wanted to get out of there.
I then [inaudible] kissing me [inaudible]. I just gave up                             I
still had shampoo in my hair. So I hurried and rinsed the shampoo out
of my hair [inaudible] get out of there. Like the closet—I just want to
clarify that-the bathroom [inaudible] bedroom where I was sleeping
and he was sleeping on the futon out in the living room he said he
70

didn't agree to that and prior to                                                         [inaudible] bedroom he would
actually come in when the door was locked. [Inaudible] easy for him
to unlock the door from the outside. I [inaudible] and I didn't want
him coming in [inaudible] key and unlock it and come in bed with me.
Id. at 218-19.
In answer to whether she recalled returning some personal items to Mr.
Corbin, including a written note, she responded, "Yes, and also we had—there was
a kitten that I didn't want and that was his, and I wanted to return the kitten to him.
[Inaudible] left the apartment [inaudible]. I felt that a note was needed with those
items [inaudible] time. How can I still not care [inaudible]?" Id. at 260. See also
id. at 263 (inaudible statement regarding whether Mr. Corbin's attorney asked Ms.
to produce emails she claimed he sent her at the injunction hearing).  The
word inaudible appears 35 times in a one-page monologue during Ms.                        's
closing statement.  As to their alleged sexual encounter in the shower, Ms.
told the Committee the following:
He had [inaudible] last statement—he claimed that that there was no
sexual intercourse together in the shower. Even if it—I just don't
understand why he says there was none, but he's also saying--
[inaudible] doesn't                                                                                                                            [inaudible]. Also, the phone that was       [inaudible]
                                                                                          that he knew that I did not want him to be with me                                               Again in
reference to                                                                              [inaudible] I                                        [inaudible] want to feel comfortable with
[inaudible] dating. I knew that I wanted to be [inaudible] with him
because that's entirely not my purpose.
Id at 410.

Without the audible portions of these statements, it is impossible to discern
their substance on the very issue of Mr. Corbin's guilt. Indeed, in the statement
above regarding whether the intercourse was consensual, it is entirely possible that
Ms.                                                                                    was entertaining the possibility that Mr. Corbin thought she consented to
sex, which would absolve him of responsibility.
2.                                                                                     Critical Pieces of Evidence Are Missing from the
Record.
The Amended Record contains typed and handwritten copies of the
questions Mr. Corbin requested that the Committee ask Ms.                              and her witnesses
during the hearing, but not all of them.  One stray page of questions starts with
number 16, with no preceding pages numbering back to 1, nor any indication of
whom the questions were for. (Vol. I-A at                                              172.)                                                                       Further, Ms.   's written
questions are not in the record at all. Because Mr. Corbin asserts herein that
Assistant Dean Loschiavo was biased against Mr. Corbin as demonstrated in part
by his refusal to ask some of Mr. Corbin's submitted questions, his missing
questions are central to an issue on appeal. The absence of Ms.                        's questions
are important as well so that Mr. Corbin can contrast his treatment to hers.
Third, the GPD recovered two poems from Mr. Corbin's apartment on the
date of the incident, a booklet (also referred to as a pamphlet) and a poem found on
the floor.                                                                             (Vol. I at                                                                  10.) Ms.       told Cpl. Armstrong that Mr. Corbin tore the
72

one he wanted to read to her in half.                                                   (Vol. I at 8.)  Det. Fair cited heavily to
excerpts from one of the poems in her investigative report, Vol. I at 11, which was
presented to the Committee to demonstrate that Mr. Corbin knew he and Ms.
were no longer romantically involved on Feb. 9, a fact that Mr. Corbin disputed.
Despite this highly prejudicial excerpt, and Det. Fair's assessment of the
meaning of the poem, as well as that she found the note "strange," Vol. II at 289-
91, neither poem was included in the record.
For all of the foregoing reasons, if this Court determines it cannot review
Mr. Corbin's claim that there was insufficient evidence of his responsibility for the
charged acts of misconduct with any accuracy, it should remand for a new hearing
that is recorded and transcribed accurately.
CONCLUSION
Each of the claims presented herein forms a basis for reversal of the
University's final order in this case. When taken cumulatively, they amount to
numerous violations of Mr. Corbin's due process right and the University's failure
to meet its burden of proof regarding the off-campus nature of the charged acts
and the acts themselves. Each error, as well as the cumulative impact of all of
them, impaired Mr. Corbin's right to receive a fair and impartial hearing and
appeal below. Thus, he respectfully asks that this Court reverse the Order below
73

and remand for a new hearing.

APPELLANT'S MOTION TO FILE AMENDED INITIAL BRIEF
COMES NOW the Appellant, CORBIN CHASE, by and through undersigned counsel, to
move for leave to file an Amended Initial Brief. As grounds therefore the following is stated:
1.                                                                                                     Mr. Corbin filed his Initial Brief in the above-styled matter on October 17, 2012. On
October 18, 2012, undersigned counsel received a phone call from the Clerk of Court informing her
that the method of redaction she used for the complainant's name was insufficient to properly guard
against identification of the complainant.
2.                                                                                                     Counsel has rectified the deficiency and has been informed by the Clerk that when an
amended brief is filed, the original brief will be placed in a folder not accessible to the general
public.
WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin respectfully requests that the Court accept his Amended Initial
Brief, in which the only adjustment is the redaction of the complainant's name, filed simultaneously
with this Motion.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the General
Counsel, University of Florida, 123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box 113125, Gainesville, FL 32611-3157, at

amhass@ufl.edu, on this the 181h day of October, 2012. It is my intent that this filing be accepted by
the court pursuant to my agreement that submitting this document for filing creates the same
obligations as my original signature would create on a paper document.

support of this Motion, Appellee states:

A.                                                        The University Deprived Mr. Corbin of Due Process by Failing
to Give Him Notice of Which Provision of Off-Campus
Conduct  he  had  Violated  and by  Failing to Find him
Responsible  for  Off-Campus  Conduct  As  Defined  by
Regulation                                                6C1-4.041, Let Alone Base  Such Finding on

B.                                                        The University Deprived Mr. Corbin of Due Process by
Submitting to the Conduct Committee Ms.                   's Narrative for
                                                          Consideration Before the Committee Made its Findings of Fact,
in Violation of Regulation 6C1-4.051                      24

The Committee Was Presented With Evidence of Highly
Prejudicial and Inadmissible Bad Acts and Other Accusations,
Including  Evidence  of Unrelated  Court  Proceedings,  All
Impugning Mr. Corbin's Character and Characterizing Ms.
                                                               as a Victim, in Violation of the University's Own Rule       26
1.                                                             The  University Allowed Ms.                                  to  Present

2.                                                             The  University Put Before the Committee for
Consideration                                                  Prejudicial   Documents                                      and

D.                                                             The Chair and Faculty Member of the Conduct Committee, the
Director of Student Conflict and Resolution, and the Dean of
Students Were Biased Against Mr. Corbin in violation of his
Right to Due Process                                           32
The Chair and Faculty Members of the Conduct
Committee Acted as Prosecutors and Improperly
Accepted Ms.                                                   's Evidence as True on Behalf
of the Committee Even Before the Hearing Had
Concluded                                                      33
2.                                                             The Director of Student Conflict and Resolution
and the Dean of Students Were Biased Against Mr.
Corbin and Should Have Recused Themselves from
Participation in His Proceedings                               35
E.                                                             MR.  CORBIN  HAS  BEEN  DENIED  DUE  PROCESS
BECAUSE  THE UNIVERSITY FAILED TO AUDIBLY
RECORD HIS HEARING AND NEITHER PARTY CAN
PROVIDE A RECORD THAT IS BOTH COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE ON APPEAL                                             44

1.                                                        A Defendant is Entitled to a New Proceeding When the
Record on Appeal is Incomplete, the Record Cannot Be
Reconstructed, the Incomplete Portions Are Necessary
for Thoughtful Review on Appeal, and the Defendant
Can Demonstrate that They Prejudiced his Presentation
of Claims                                                 44
2.                                                        The Amended Record on Appeal Is So Incomplete and
Inaccurate that the Court Cannot Complete a Full Review
of Mr. Corbin's Claims and His Presentation of Those
Claims Has Been Compromised Such that the Court
Must Vacate the Final Order Below and Remand for a
New Hearing                                               46

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On March 18, 2011, Appellant Chase Corbin was informed by letter from
Chris Loschiavo, Assistant Dean and Director of Student Conduct and Conflict
Resolution for the University of Florida ("the University"), that the University had
received information from the Gainesville Police Department ("GPD") indicating
that on February 9, 2011, Mr. Corbin may have violated the University's standards
by committing a sexual battery against his ex-girlfriend,                              , at an off-
campus residence. (Vol. I at 29.) The University charged him with Sexual Assault,
Sexual Misconduct, Harrassment and Threats, violations of Administrative Code
Regulation 6C1-4.041(4)(b)(1)-(2) and (4)(c)(1) of its Student Conduct Code. Id.
Mr. Corbin was granted a hearing before the Student Conduct Committee
("the Committee"), comprised of three students and two faculty members. (Vol. I
at 60-2; Vol. II at 202, 204.)                                                         Although  the  University  initially  imposed  an
interim suspension and trespass order on Mr. Corbin, Vice President and Dean of
Students Jen Day Shaw lifted both on March 28, 2011, allowing him full access to
the University pending conduct proceedings.                                            (Vol. I at 34.)
The hearing was held on December 2, 2011, and was presided over by Mr.
Loschiavo.  The Committee recommended that Mr. Corbin be found responsible
for all three allegations and that he be suspended from the University from Spring

semester 2012 through Spring semester 2013. It also recommended a no contact
order vis-à-vis Ms.                                                                      , and that he undergo sexual violence and anger
management counseling. Mr. Corbin's registration, transcript, degree certification
and diploma were also placed on hold. (Vol. I-A at 159-61.)
On December 15, 2011, Dean Shaw notified Mr. Corbin by letter that she
concurred with the recommendations of the Conduct Committee. The suspension
was imposed and an overlay was placed on his record indicating he was not in
good standing. Mr. Corbin was informed he might have to reapply for admission in
spring 2013. Finally, Mr. Corbin could not have any intentional contact with
and had to undergo counseling. Id. at 183-84.
On December 22, 2011, Mr. Corbin filed an appeal with Dr. Mary Kay
Carodine, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs, which was denied on
January 17, 2012. Id. at 186-90. However, Dr. Carodine adjusted the sanctions by
allowing Mr. Corbin to meet with her in September 2012, to discuss readmission
for Spring 2013 semester. The denial states that it "constitutes the final decision of
the University of Florida with respect to this matter."  Id. at                          195-96. A timely
notice of appeal was filed with this Court on February 3, 2012. Id. at 200.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Mr. Corbin and the complainant presented two very different versions of the
2

events on February 9, 2011. Two facts stand out, however:  Mr. Corbin took and
passed a polygraph examination, Vol. I at 197-98, and the Eighth Judicial Circuit's
State Attorney dropped the charges against him that formed the basis for these
proceedings because the evidence was inadequate to sustain a conviction, Vol. I at
151. It was only after the State filed a Notice of No Information that that the Office
of Student Conduct informed Mr. Corbin of University proceedings against him.
                                                                                         According police reports and testimony, Mr. Corbin and Ms.                      were
                                                                                         interrupted in their joint apartment by Gainesville Police Department           (GPD)
                                                                                         officers on February 9, 2011, following a phone call from Michael Hengelbrok,
Ms.                                                                                      's boyfriend. Mr. Hengelbrok indicated that he was awakened by a phone
call from Ms.                                                                            's cell phone at                                                                11:22 a.m. When he picked up the phone, he
heard Ms.                                                                                screaming in the background for someone to get off her. Mr.
Hengelbrok "immediately got up and began driving to her apartment." He received
numerous calls between 11:37 and 11:53 a.m., but did not pick up. (Vol. I at 121.)
Ms.                                                                                      told GPD Corporal Richard Armstrong that she and Mr. Corbin
had been in a relationship until approximately two months before the incident, but
were living together out of financial necessity. Id. She had stayed with Mr.
Hengelbrok, her current boyfriend of six weeks, id. at 1-a, 7; Vol. II at 252-53, for
the prior three nights because she was growing increasingly scared of Mr. Corbin.
3

She came home on February 9 to feed her pets and take a shower.                        (Vol. I at 1-a.)
Ms.                                                                                    told Detective Lorraine Fair, who arrived on the scene with
Detective Victoria Young after Cpl. Armstrong, that Mr. Corbin was home when
Ms.                                                                                    arrived. He tried to give her a booklet he had written for her, but she told
him she had to go to class and he put the booklet in one of her shoes. He then went
out to his car to get her project for school, which he had been storing for her. She
went into the bathroom to take a shower, locking the door. Id at 7; Vol. II at 279.
Ms.                                                                                    reported that while she was in the shower, Mr. Corbin entered the
bedroom and somehow unlocked her cell phone to look at whom she had been
calling. He then verbally confronted her from outside the bathroom door. When
she told him to leave her alone, he kicked open the bathroom door and asked her
whom she had been sleeping with.  She exited the shower and told him to leave
her alone and then got back into the shower.                                           (Vol. I at 1-a; see also Vol. 2 at 279.)
Mr. Corbin disrobed and entered the shower. Despite Ms.                                's repeated requests
that he leave, he "forcibly penetrated her vagina with his penis."                     (Vol. I at                                                                     1-a;
Vol.                                                                                   2 at 280.) At that point, "she no longer had the energy to defend herself."
(Vol. I at                                                                             1-a.) Cpl. Armstrong's report indicated that according to Ms.                  , Mr.
Corbin was inside her only a few seconds and did not ejaculate. Id
1 Ms.                                                                                  told Det. Fair that she did not remember what else Mr. Corbin
said to her in the bathroom, but that he kept calling her a "whore." (Vol. I at 7.)
4

By contrast, Ms.                                                                     told Det. Fair that when Mr. Corbin got in the shower,
he "pushed [Ms. I                                                                    n                                                                      up against the wall ... and pushed his penis into her vagina
from behind a few times." She told him to stop. (Vol. I at 7-8) (emphasis added).
When they both exited the shower she ran to the bedroom closet to change. He
followed her with her phone in his hand and was screaming and crying. When she
tried to get the phone back, he kept throwing it so she could not reach it.  Mr.
Corbin pushed her down in the closet. Id. at 8; Vol. II at 280.
Det. Fair's report reflected that Ms.                                                then crawled out into the living
room and Mr. Corbin was still screaming at her, ripping up his poem.                 (Vol. I at 8.)
He then threatened to kill himself with a rope in the loft and took out a KA-Bar
knife, asking her if she wanted him to go to jail, that he would fight Hengelbrok.
This continued until the police arrived.                                             (Vol. I at 8; see also Vol. 2 at 281.)
It was not until later, when asked if she had any injuries from the incident,
that Ms.                                                                             told Det. Fair that when Mr. Corbin was on top of her in the closet,
he kissed and sucked on her neck, leaving marks there. (Vol. I at 8.) Ms.
refused a rape examination because the attack happened in the shower and she said
Mr. Corbin did not ejaculate. Id.; see also Vol. II at 288.
Of the three voicemail messages on Mr. Hengelbrok's phone, only one
contains Mr. Corbin's voice and is transcribed as follows: "Listen to me, you
5

mother fu**er cock sucker. Stay away from                                             . She's mine. And if you don't
                                                                                      think she's mine, why don't you ask her who she was with this morning, who she
                                                                                      let inside of her. B**ch." (Vol. I at 9.) The other two messages appear to contain
Ms.                                                                                   's voice, crying. In one, she can be heard screaming, "Give me my phone"
and "Stop it." (Vol. III at 424.)
                                                                                      At the Conduct Hearing, Cpl. Armstrong told the Committee that after
questioning Ms.                                                                       , he went outside and asked Mr. Corbin to tell him what had
happened. Appellant told him he had gone to check on Ms.                              because she had
fainted in the shower. She yelled at him to get out when he asked whom she had
been seeing and then she "grabbed his pants and pulled them off of him, leading
him into the shower." They then had consensual sex, after which Ms.                   started
yelling at him again. Id. at                                                          1-a. Armstrong alleged that after taking this statement,
Cpl. Armstrong instructed GPD Officer Hinson to advise Mr. Corbin of his
Miranda rights, at which point Appellant requested to speak with his lawyer. Id. at
1-a, 2.
When Det. Fair and Det. Young subsequently arrived on the scene, Cpl.
Armstrong did not mention the above statement when conveying to Fair the details
of his investigation. Id. at                                                          7. Det. Fair noted four times in as many pages of
testimony that Mr. Corbin invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-
6

incrimination, so would not speak to the officers. Id. at 281, 293-96. Det. Young,
however, wrote in her report that she went to speak with Mr. Corbin and that he
spontaneously offered the same statement apparently relayed to Cpl. Armstrong,
despite having previously invoked his Fifth Amendment right to silence which,
according to Young, he did again after speaking with her. Id. at 6. Cpl. Armstrong
                                                                                     concluded that Mr. Corbin had forcibly, sexually battered Ms.                  and placed him
under arrest. Id. at 2,                                                              151.
Mr. Corbin testified that he kicked the bathroom door out of anger, but did
not bust it open—Ms.                                                                 opened it for him. He called her a whore and asked
whom she had been sleeping with, at which time she pulled him into the shower
and seduced him. He did not enter her because he was not aroused.  They
continued arguing after they got out of the shower and Mr. Corbin tried to leave.
Ms.                                                                                  blocked his exit and the police came shortly thereafter. (Vol. II at 313-14,
324.) He admitted to leaving an angry message on Mr. Hengelbrok's phone, but
asserted that Ms.                                                                    made the other calls in an effort to set him up.                               (Vol. II at
334.)
In his closing statement, Mr. Corbin told the committee that he hoped to
graduate with highest honors in Philosophy and Economics and that the false
allegations against him have put his life on hold. He submitted several character

letters to the Committee from ex-girlfriend Jamie Stafford, current girlfriend Kayla
Noel Johnston, Regan Garner of the University Honors Program, and urban
economics professor Dr. Denslow. Id. at 25-6.

The record below contains numerous inconsistencies in Ms.                              's version
of the events, which are discussed in the Argument section of this Brief.
SCOPE OF JURISDICTION
This matter comes before the Court as an appeal of a final order by an
administrative agency, the University of Florida. A final order is one that "fully
disposes of the case before the lower tribunal." Morfit v. University of South
Florida, 794 So. 2d 655 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). The final order in this case is the
letter by the University's Vice President for Student Affairs affirming the Dean of
Students' decision that Mr. Corbin violated three provisions of the University's
Student Code of Conduct and that sanctions, including suspension, should be
applied. See Vol. I at                                                                 183-84,                                                             195-96; Admin. Code Reg. 6C1-4.048 (available at
http://regulations.ufl.edu/chapter4/4048.pdf, last accessed Sept. 20, 2012).
Mr. Corbin is aware of this Court's April 24, 2012, decision holding that
state universities do not constitute administrative agencies subject to the APA as
defined by section 120.521 of the Florida Statutes. See Decker v. Univ. of W. Fla.,
85 So. 3d 571                                                                          (Fla. 1st DCA 2012); see also Couchman v. Univ. of Cent. Fla., 84
8

So.                                                                                     3d 445 (Fla.                                                      5th DCA 2012). These decisions are in conflict with the Third
District Court of Appeal's application of the APA to University proceedings. See,
e.g., Matar v. Fla. Int'l Univ.,                                                        944 So. 2d 1153 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006). Decker was
issued after Mr. Corbin filed his notice of appeal in the lower tribunal and the
Court appears to have accepted jurisdiction in this case based on its various orders
to date.
However, in an abundance of caution, Mr. Corbin briefly addresses the
holding in Decker, which held that "when an officer or agency is exercising power
derived from the constitution, the resulting decision is not one that is made by an
agency as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act." Decker 85 So. 3d at 573.
The Court went on to find that the University's imposition of sanctions against a
student falls within the scope of Article IX, section                                   7                                                                 (d)  of the Florida
Constitution, which requires that the state board of governors "'operate, regulate,
control and be fully responsible for the management of the whole university
system,' and section 7(cl, which states that each university within the system shall
be operated by a board of trustees under powers granted by the board of
governors." Id.                                                                         (citations omitted). Because the University was engaging in the
operation and management of the university system when it suspended Mr. Decker,
it was not subject to the APA, thereby eviscerating Decker's right to a direct appeal
9

before this Court. Id. at 572.
Mr. Corbin respectfully argues that section 120.52(1) should be construed to
mean that an entity's exercise of power derived solely from the constitution would
exempt the entity from the APA. But if the entity is acting in accordance with a
more specific statute, it is "acting pursuant to powers other than [i.e., distinct from
or in addition to] those derived from the constitution." Here, although the
University was engaging in management and operation derived from constitutional
provisions when it suspended Mr. Corbin, it was also acting pursuant to Florida
statutes.  See, e.g., § 20.155, Fla. Stat. (2012) (The Board of Governors shall
operate, regulate, control, and be responsible for the management of the whole
State University System in accordance with § 7, Art. IX of the State Constitution
and  law.").  More  specifically,  the  University  acted  pursuant  to  Florida
Administrative Code regulations that it implemented pursuant to the APA. See §§
120.536,                                                                                  120.54, Fla. Stat. To find that the application of the Code, which derives
its power from the APA, is not subject to the APA, strains any reading of Section
120.52                                                                                    (1).
By contrast, Mr. Corbin's reading of the provision is consistent with section
120.81                                                                                    (1)                                                                          (g) of the APA, which provides, "Sections   120.569 and   120.57 do not
apply to any proceeding in which the . substantial interests of a student are
10

determined by a state university or a community college." This provision would
serve no purpose if the legislature intended to exempt state universities from the
APA.
Finally, this Court's decision in Gopman v. Dep't of Educ., 908 So. 2d 1118
(Fla.                                                                                   1st DCA                                                               2005), which was issued after Article IX, section   7 of the
constitution was passed, 2 cannot be squared with Decker. In Gopman, the Court
reviewed an order of the Department of Education denying eligibility for an
educational scholarship to an applicant.  On appeal, the Department argued that
section                                                                                 1009.42  of the  Florida Statutes should be  construed as replacing
application of the APA.
The Court first stated, "The Administrative Procedure Act presumptively
governs the exercise of all authority statutorily vested in the executive branch of
state government. Gopman, 908 So. 2d at 1120 (citing 4i.                                120.50, Fla. Stat. (2003)
("This chapter shall not apply to: (1) The Legislature; (2) The courts.")). Just like
2
In Decker v. Univ. of W. Fla., 85 So. 3d 571, 573 (Fla. 1st DCA 2012), the
Court noted that its decision exempting state universities from the APA was
contrary to its earlier precedent, but that these cases were either decided before
Article IX, section 7 was added to the constitution in 2002, or relied on precedent
that was. Neither exception applies to Alpha Eta Chptr. Of Pi Kappa Alpha
Fraternity v. Univ. of Fla.—the case was decided in 2008 and the Court relied
solely on constitutional and statutory provisions in concluding the university is an
administrative agency subject to the APA. Alpha Eta Chptr. of Pi Kappa Alpha
Fraternity, 982 So. 2d 55, 55-56 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008).
11

state universities,  the  Executive  Branch derives its power from Florida's
Constitution, see Art. IV, as does the Department of Education, see Art. IX, § 2.
Yet, the legislature has specifically stated that the APA presumptively governs
executive action, and this Court in Gopman held that the DOE is an administrative
agency subject to the APA for that very reason. Gopman, 908 So. 2d at 1123.
If the Decker interpretation of section                                              120.52                                    (1) were applied, not only
would Gopman have been wrongly decided, but the exception would surely
swallow the rule. Article IV, section                                                6 of the Constitution provides for the
"administration of each [executive] department" with certain exceptions. Under the
Court's analysis, the "administration" of any department that derives its power
from this constitutional provision—the Department of Corrections, the Department
of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Regulation—would be
exempt from the APA.   But each of these departments has been deemed an
administrative agency subject to the APA and this Court has served in an appellate
capacity where the administration of those agency actions has been challenged.
See, e.g., Dep't of Corrections v. Adams, 458 So.                                    2d 354 (Fla.                              1st DCA                      1984)
(treating DOC as administrative agency subject to APA); Rosenzweig v. Dep't of
Transportation, 979 So. 2d 1050 (Fla.                                                1st DCA 2008) (same as to DOT); Friends
of Hatchineha, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Environmental Regulation, 580 So. 2d 267
12

(Fla. 1st DCA 1991) (same as to Dep't of Environmental Regulation). See also See
Griffis v. Fla. Fish & Wildlife Conservation Comm 'n, 57 So. 3d 929 (1st DCA
2011) (same as to Fish & Wildlife Comm'n); Alpha Eta Chptr. of Pi Kappa Alpha
Fraternity v. Univ. of Fla., 982 So. 2d 55, 55-6 (Fla.                               1st DCA 2008) (same as to
University of Florida)). For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Corbin believes this Court
has jurisdiction to hear his appeal pursuant to section 120.68 of the APA.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
An appellate court should generally uphold an administrative agency
decision if it is supported by competent, substantial evidence.  Seneca v. Fla.
Unemployment Appeals Comm'n,                                                         39 So.                      3d                                                              385,   387   (Fla.   1st DCA   2010).
However, the agency's application of the law is reviewed de novo. City of Coral
Gables v. Coral Gables Walter F. Stathers Mem 'I Lodge                               7, Fraternal Order of
Police, 976 So. 2d 57, 63 (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (citation omitted).
Section                                                                              120.68                      (7) of the Florida Statutes provides that the appellate court
must reverse the final order of an agency when
b) the agency's action depends on any finding of fact that is not
supported by competent, substantial evidence in the record; c) The
fairness of the proceedings or the correctness of the action may have
been impaired by a material error in procedure or a failure to follow
prescribed procedure; ... e) The agency's exercise of discretion was:
... 2. Inconsistent with agency rule[.]

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
First, the University's Order was not supported with competent and
substantial evidence as required by law. Second, the University deprived Mr.
Corbin of due process in five substantive ways: A) it failed to provide him with
notice of the grounds on which it charged him with off-campus conduct, nor was
competent or substantial evidence presented to permit the off-campus charges; B)
it violated the Administrative Code by allowing the Committee to consider the
complainant's written, victim impact statement before it made its findings
regarding Mr. Corbin's responsibility; C) it prevented Mr. Corbin from presenting
certain character evidence to the Committee, while simultaneously permitting Ms.
's presentation, in both written and testimonial form, of bad character/bad acts
evidence  pertaining  to  Mr.  Corbin;  D) the  Committee  members took a
prosecutorial posture with Mr. Corbin and the University's facilitator and final
decision-maker were biased against Mr. Corbin in ways that prejudiced the
proceedings; and E) the University failed to audibly record the proceedings below.
Thus, this Court must vacate the finding of responsibility and vacate the sanctions
against Mr. Corbin..

ARGUMENT
I.                                                                                  THE UNIVERSITY BASED ITS ORDER ON FINDINGS OF FACT
THAT   WERE   NOT   SUPPORTED   BY   COMPETENT  AND
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
Regulation 6C1-4.042(8) provides that student conduct proceedings "shall
be based upon a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard"
and that the agency's ruling must be supported by competent and substantial
evidence. Seneca v. Fla. Unemployment Appeals Comm 'n, 39 So. 3d 385, 387 (Fla.
1st DCA 2010).
In the case at bar, the Order below did not meet this burden as to its finding
of responsibility for sexual assault and sexual misconduct. On those two charges,
the Conduct Committee found the following facts to support its recommendation:
As to 6C1-4.041(4)(b)1, Ms.                                                         's initial report indicated non consensual sex and
was detailed, indicating that she pushed Mr. Corbin away and said no. Mr.
Corbin's story was inconsistent, and he forced himself into the bathroom and
uttered angry comments to Ms.                                                       and Mr. Hengelbrok. As to                            4   (b)2, the
Committee found it was "implicit by being responsible for 4(b)1[.]" (Vol. I-A at
159.)
It is noteworthy that the same facts were used to support findings of
15

concept of "double jeopardy" is not applied in agency proceedings, the double
charges here seem to violate the spirit, if not the letter, of University Regulation
6C1-4.041(2)(d)(1), which addresses off-campus conduct:  ". . .                         [T                                                                              he conduct
authority of the University will not be used merely to duplicate the penalty
imposed for such an act under applicable ordinances and laws."
As important, the facts on which the Committee relied do not meet the
"competent and substantial evidence" test.  Most significantly, the Committee
found Mr. Corbin's descriptions of the incident to be inconsistent and Ms.              's
to be more detailed, Vol. I-A at 159, the implication being that her report was not
inconsistent. To be sure, Ms.                                                           was consistent in claiming that Mr. Corbin had
touched her against her will, but her credibility on that point is very much called
into question by the utter inconsistency on specifics she provided in police reports,
her Narrative, and then at the Hearing.
To Cpl. Armstrong, Ms.                                                                  stated that • when Mr. Corbin entered the
bathroom, she simply got out of the shower, told him to leave her alone, and then
got back into the shower. Mr. Corbin disrobed and entered the shower. Despite
her repeated requests that he leave, he "forcibly penetrated her vagina with his
penis."                                                                                 (Vol. I at 1-a; Vol. II at 280.) At that point, "she no longer had the energy
to defend herself."                                                                     (Vol. I at                                                                      1-a.)  Mr. Corbin was inside her for only a few
16

seconds and did not ejaculate. Id. Yet, She told Det. Fair that once in the shower,
Mr. Corbin pushed her up against the wall and penetrated her "a few times."             (Vol.
I at 7-8.) In her Narrative, she wrote that Mr. Corbin had only "tried to enter" her.
Id. at 14.
Ms.                                                                                     's testimony to the Committee, given ten months after the incident,
was significantly more detailed. She asserted that when she got out of the shower
to confront Mr. Corbin, they had a struggle over her phone. (Vol. II at 218.) Mr.
Corbin was kissing her all over her neck in the shower with her back towards the
wall. When she moved away from him, he turned her around and entered her. Id. at
217-18. At that point, she was able to push him away. Id. at 218-19; compare Vol.
I at 1-a (he penetrated her and she no longer had the energy to defend herself); Vol.
II at 299 (Det. Fair testifying that Ms.                                                had not struggled at all once in the
shower: "she was too tired to fight him and she just basically stood there.").
Regarding the incidents after the shower, Ms.                                           's accounts differ as well.
In her report to Det. Fair, she stated that when they both got out of the shower, she
ran to the bedroom closet and Mr. Corbin followed her. Id. at 8. In her Narrative,
she hurried to the closet to get dressed when he left her alone in the bathroom.
(Vol. I at 14-5.)
She told Det. Fair Mr. Corbin pushed her down in the closet and kissed and
17

sucked on her neck. She then crawled to the living room, at which time Mr. Corbin
ripped the poem he had written for her and threatened to kill himself with a rope,
then held up a KA-Bar knife. (Vol. I at 8.) In her Narrative, however, Ms.
describes another detailed struggle over her phone during which Mr. Corbin kept
calling Mr. Hengelbrok. He would not let her out of the closet. Despite her
screaming to stop, he hovered over her and held her on the ground, left her there
and came back with two different ropes, one short and one heavy. Then he left the
closet, went to the living room and climbed up to their loft where he tied the
heavier rope around a podium and threatened to kill himself. She followed him into
the living room. Their argument lasted a few hours.                                      (Vol. I at 15.)
In still another version, Ms.                                                            told the Committee that Mr. Corbin went in
and out of the closet three times, each time bringing back a different rope, the first
a short one, the second a longer one and the last the heavy one. He tied the second
rope around his neck and asked if she wanted him to commit suicide—he pulled
the rope so hard it snapped off his neck. (Vol. II at 220-22.) Despite his absence
when he left to get each rope, she apparently never attempted to leave the closet.
It was the third rope that Mr. Corbin apparently tied to the podium and
threatened to hang himself with. Again, despite his being upstairs in the loft, she
made no effort to escape. She eventually fell to the ground and he held her until the
18

police came. Id. at 222-23.
By contrast, Mr. Corbin was consistent in his reporting on the incident both
to his father, on recorded jail calls, and to the Committee.                               (Vol. I at                      11-12
(description of events to father during jail call); Vol. II at 313-14, 324 (statement to
Committee). To be sure, in his Case Supplemental Report, Cpl. Armstrong claimed
that Mr. Corbin gave him a statement which is inconsistent in two respects with
Mr. Corbin's testimony before the Committee and his phone calls to his father. He
allegedly indicated to Armstrong that he went into the bathroom to check on Ms.
because she had fainted in the shower and that after she pulled him into the
shower, they had consensual sex. (Vol. I at 1-a.)                                          However,   there   are   vast
inconsistencies among the three reporting officers'  accounts of his alleged
statement, the most important of which is Det. Fair's testimony to the Committee
that the officers did not go speak to Mr. Corbin because he had invoked his right to
an attorney/silence. This calls into question not only Cpl. Armstrong's report, but
also Det. Young's report that she did go speak to Mr. Corbin. Id. at 1-a— 6; Vol. 2
at 281. Mr. Corbin maintained to the Committee that he never gave a statement to
the police and knew better because his father is an attorney. (Vol. II at 365.)
Det. Young's and Cpl. Armstrong's contention that Mr. Corbin made a
statement is either highly unlikely or constituted a violation of Mr. Corbin's Fifth
19

Amendment right against self-incrimination. Whichever the case, the Committee's
contention that Ms.                                                                    's version of events was more reliable than Mr. Corbin's
because of its consistency and detail is belied by the record. The more detailed
Ms.                                                                                    's portrayal became, the more inconsistent it became.
As to the other specific findings of fact by the Committee, they, too, are
unsupported. First, the Committee found that Ms.                                       pushed Mr. Corbin away
and said no. As explained above, she reported pushing him away on one occasion
and giving in because she did not have the energy on another. Second, the.
Committee found compelling the fact that her initial report indicated non-
consensual sex.  While that may be the case, her initial report is the one that left
out significant details and contradicted the Committee's other finding that she
pushed Mr. Corbin away. (Vol. I at 1-a). Further, Ms.                                  's Narrative contradicts
the finding because it states only that Mr. Corbin "tried" to ,enter her. Id. at 14.
As to the Committee's finding that Mr. Corbin broke into the bathroom, this
finding is called into question by the physical evidence—specifically, the pictures
of the bathroom door, which show no evidence the frame or lock were damaged,
and Det. Fair's testimony. See Supp. Rec. at 428 (pictures showing that neither the
lock nor the frame of the bathroom door were disturbed in any way); Vol. II at 285
(Det. Fair's testimony there was no sawdust or wood chips under the bathroom
20

door); Vol. I at 48.
While Mr. Corbin certainly admitted saying terrible things to Ms.                         and
Mr. Hengelbrok, that cannot alone support the Committee's recommendation and
the findings of responsibility that flowed from them. Neither the Dean of Students
nor the Vice President for Student Affairs made any findings of facts in their
orders at all.                                                                            (Vol. I-A at 184,                                    195-6.) Accordingly, the University failed to meet
its burden of proof in finding Mr. Corbin responsible for a violations of Regulation
6C1-4.041(4)(b)(1) and (2).
II.                                                                                       MR.  CORBIN'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS WAS VIOLATED IN
THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW.
The Supreme Court has held that a student facing suspension from a public
school has property and liberty interests that require protection under the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 581
(1985). Although student disciplinary hearings do not require the same safeguards
required for criminal proceedings, Gordon v. Savage, 383 So.                              2d 646 (Fla.                                         5th
DCA 1980), due process does require "adequate notice, an opportunity to be heard,
and substantial evidence to support the penalty." Student Alpha Id Number Guja v.
School Bd. of Volusia County, 616 So. 2d 1011, 1012-1013 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993).
Under section                                                                             120.81                                               (1)                                                  (g) of the Florida Statutes, entitled "educational
units," where a student's "substantial interests" are affected by a state university or
21

community college, the general due process standards established in sections
120.569 and                                                                              120.57 of the APA do not apply. §                      120.81   (1)   (g), Fla. Stat.; Morfit,
794 So. 2d at 656.  Among other sanctions, Mr. Corbin was suspended from the
University for a year, a sanction that this Court has determined affects a student's
substantial interests. See Morfit, 794 So. 2d at 656. Thus, the proceedings below
were governed by the rules and guidelines established by the Board of Regents to
ensure fairness and due process in proceedings involving student misconduct. Id. at
656. These include Regulations 6C1-4.040-4.051, which delineate the due process
requirements for the  student honor and conduct codes at the University.

A.                                                                                       The University Deprived Mr. Corbin of Due Process by
Failing to Give Him Notice of Which Provision of Off-
Campus Conduct he had Violated and by Failing to Find
him Responsible for Off-Campus Conduct As Defined by
Regulation 6C1-4.041.
This claim was preserved below for appellate review.                                     (Vol. I at 186; Vol. I-
A at 187.) Administrative Code Regulation 6C1-4.041(2)(d)(2) of the University's
Code of Conduct permits the University to impose disciplinary action for off-
campus conduct "if it is required by law to do so, if the conduct arises from
University activities, or if the conduct poses a significant threat of undermining the
University's educational process." Regulation 6C1-4042(6)(b)(1)(a) provides that a
22

student in conduct proceedings has a "basic right" to notice of the charges against
him at least seven business days prior to the date of the conduct hearing.
In the University's March 18, 2011, letter to Mr. Corbin informing him that
based on information from the GPD, the University was charging him with three
violations of the Code of Conduct, there is no mention of the 6C1-4.041(2)(d)(2)
requirements, nor the basis on which the University was charging him with off-
campus conduct. (Vol.                                                                 1 at 29-30.) The same is true for the University's October
19, 2012, and November 8, 2011, letters providing him notice of his initial and
subsequently scheduled conduct hearings. Id. at 76, 85.)
Similarly, the Student Conduct Committee Pre-Hearing Summary, which
informed the Committee of the charges it was to consider, did not include the three
conditions for pursuing off-campus conduct, nor did it instruct the Committee that
it was required to find that Mr. Corbin's conduct fell within one of the three
provisions.                                                                           (Vol.                                                        1-A at 111-12.) Thus, the Committee made no such finding, nor
did any of the facts found by the Committee support any of the three conditions
established in section 4.041(2)(d)(2). (Vol. 1 at 159-60.)
Dean Shaw's December 15, 2011, letter approving the Committee's findings
did not address whether the conduct falls within the scope of regulation 4.041, nor
whether the University made the requisite findings of fact to meet its burden of
23

proof on that issue. (Vol.                                                              1 at 183-84.) Finally, Mr. Corbin's first claim on appeal
to Assistant Vice President Carodine alleged that charging him for off-campus
conduct violated his right to due process. (Vol.                                        1-A at                                                      187.) Yet, her January   17,
2011, letter approving the Committee's findings fails to address that claim.            (Vol.
1-A at 194-96.)
Thus, the University violated its own regulation requiring notice and
competent, substantial evidence to support its final order, and in doing so, violated
Mr. Corbin's right to due process. See Guerra v. State, Department of Labor &
Employment Security, 427 So.2d 1098, 1103 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).
B.                                                                                      The University Deprived Mr. Corbin of Due Process by
                                                                                        Submitting to the Conduct Committee Ms.                     's Narrative
Before  the  Committee Made its Findings  of Fact,  in
Violation of Regulation 6C1-4.051.
This  Claim  was  not  preserved below  and  should  be  reviewed for
fundamental error. Administrative Code Regulation 6C1-4.051(4) provides certain
accommodations for victims of violence which include "Submitting a written
impact statement to the hearing body after the finding of facts which shall be
considered during sanctioning, should the accused student be found responsible for
the violation." (Emphasis added.) This rule is presumably designed to prevent the
Committee from considering the impact on the victim when deciding the factual
issue of whether or not the student committed the violation(s).
24

In the proceedings below, the Conduct Committee was given a copy of Ms.
's Narrative containing a lengthy impact statement, prior to the Conduct
Hearing and its members were not instructed to disregard it when determining Mr.
Corbin's responsibility for the charged violations. The Narrative contained highly
inflammatory language pertaining to Ms.                                                 's emotional state, language clearly
designed to evoke an emotional response from the Committee. See, e.g., (Vol. I at
14) ("We were together for nearly two years, during which I felt as though I was
far in too deep into the ground. Into the ground from where I could not see sunlight
or from where I could not be heard from.") It also included an entire section titled,
"Psychological, Social & Financial Impact," in which Ms.                                asserted she would
"never be the same again." Id. at 15. She wrote that she feared for her life, was
terrified at night, could not sleep, jumped at "every little noise,"  was staying in
bed, missing classes, and sleeping as a way to "shut the world and these problems
out." She named numerous organizations from which she had sought counseling
and wrote that she had dropped many of her academic endeavors. Id. at 15-6.
This victim impact evidence should have been confined to the Committee's
consideration of Mr. Corbin's sanctions, not his responsibility.  The prejudice
stemming from such emotional outpourings cannot be overestimated and strikes at
the heart of the fundamental fairness of Mr. Corbin's proceedings, thereby
25

requiring a new hearing.
C.                                                                                    The Committee Was Presented With Evidence of Highly
Prejudicial   and   Inadmissible   Bad   Acts   and   Other
Accusations,   Including  Evidence  of  Unrelated   Court
Proceedings, All Im u ning Mr. Corbin's Character and
Characterizing Ms.                                                                    as a Victim, in Violation of the
University's Own Rule.
This claim was preserved in part for review. See Vol. III at 413 (Mr. Corbin
in closing objecting to new allegations raised by Ms.                                 that bore no relevance to
the issue before the Committee); Vol. II at 188-89; Vol. III at 413. Mr. Corbin did
not object to the admission of evidence pertaining to the injunction against him.
1.                                                                                    The  University Allowed Ms.                           to  Present
Character Evidence at the Hearing Despite Its
Own Prohibition Against Such Evidence.
The  University's  Student  Conduct  Informational  Meeting  Checklist
addresses the procedures for a Conduct Hearing. It provides, in pertinent part,
"Character witnesses are not able to present information during a hearing but they
may submit a written statement." In accordance with this rule, Mr. Corbin
submitted written statements from a prior girlfriend, a current girlfriend, and two
professors who spoke to Mr. Corbin's character as a boyfriend and a student of
integrity. See Vol. I at 25-8.
By contrast, Ms.                                                                      f                                                     was permitted to present testimony about Mr.
Corbin's character, including in her closing statement so that Mr. Corbin had no
26

opportunity to rebut the allegations with evidence or witness testimony.  Ms.
's evidence went well beyond simply describing Mr. Corbin as untrustworthy
or a bad boyfriend, it consisted of very specific instances of prior bad acts that the
University had instructed the parties, again and again, were beyond the scope of
the hearing, the focus of which was to be solely the February 9, 2012, incident. See
Vol. I at 73-4                                                                           (Assistant Dean Loschiavo emailing Terry Silverman, "As far as
Chase has made me aware, neither of you have knowledge of what occurred that
night, which is what the hearing is about so I don't know how important your
information will be (I'm not saying it isn't important, but I want to emphasize that
the hearing is about what occurred the night in question it is not about Chase's
character.")); Vol. II at 202 (Loschiavo dictating that the focus of the hearing was
to be entirely on "the alleged incident" on February 9, 2011). Yet, again and again,
Assistant Dean Loschiavo, who was acting as gatekeeper for the admission of
evidence, allowed highly inflammatory character testimony and evidence to be put
before the Committee.
In her opening statement, Ms.                                                            alleged that Mr. Corbin had an anger
problem and that he would sometimes just "go berserk." (Vol. II at 209.) She let it
go because she "knew why he was so angry.                                                [She] knew his past in terms of
negative [inaudible] with his mother, his relationships with past girlfriends." Id.;
27

see also id. at 243. Later she injected that she had wanted to call a friend of hers as
a witness. The friend had approached her the day before the hearing to tell her that
Mr. Corbin had had trouble with other girlfriends. She was best friends with him in
high school and "was there for him when he was with his mental health treatments
and his past girlfriends, and he was on suicide watch."3 Id. at 234.
Det. Fair testified that Ms.                                                              told her that Mr. Corbin had threatened and
hit her in the past.                                                                      (Vol. II at 281.) Fair's Supplemental Report was given to the
Committee unredacted, despite the fact that it contained a long description of prior
acts of aggression against Ms.                                                            by Mr. Corbin. (Vol. I at 8.) Det. Fair also told
the Committee that Ms.                                                                    "basically displayed all the signs of a classic
domestic violence victim, which in belief is what she was. (Vol. II at 281.)
In her Narrative, Ms.                                                                     included five paragraphs detailing prior bad acts
by Mr. Corbin, all irrelevant to the incident on February                                 9. She described one
episode on January                                                                        14, 2011, when he woke her up enraged, and spit in her face.
When he got in his car to leave, she tried to stop him because "[hie is notorious for
his road rage and reckless driving."                                                      (Vol. II at 16-7.)                                              She also described being
terrified on a camping trip with Mr. Corbin over the winter break when he lost his

particularly helpful because it was hearsay, he made clear that "if we had the
individual here that would be helpful."                                                   (Vol. II at 234.) This improperly signaled
to the Committee that it could consider this type of character evidence.
28

temper and started swinging his knife around. He was degrading and made ethnic
comments. Id. at 17.
In her closing statement, Ms.                                                             lodged entirely new attacks on Mr.
Corbin's character using hearsay and more allegations of prior bad acts.  She
asserted that Det. Fair told Ms.                                                          how "unstable" Mr. Corbin was. Id. at 410.
For the first time she alleged that an ex-girlfriend of Mr. Corbin's, Alexandra (last
name inaudible), who "was there for him when he was admitted to a psychiatric
ward[,]" told Ms.                                                                         that he had raped her. "That's why she wanted to warn me."
Another friend, when she heard about the incident, texted Ms.                             to tell her the
"she was there for me." Id. at 412.
Mr. Corbin made every effort to rebut Ms.                                                 's character attacks, but he
did not have the benefit of preparation or witnesses. When he objected to the new
allegations, Mr. Loschiavo told him they were fair game because Mr. Corbin had
"brought it into play" when his investigator discussed his ex-girlfriends. (Vol. III at
412.) This is inaccurate. Ms.                                                             t referenced Mr. Corbin's ex-girlfriends and his
character several times in her opening statement and in answering questions from
the Committee. See, e.g., Vol. II at                                                      209,                                                         234,   2543.  Thus, Mr. Corbin's only
option was to present rebuttal evidence, to the extent possible, through his
investigator. His investigator's rebuttal was very general and could not have cured

                                                                                                                                                      picked up and focused on the character evidence that Ms.                                                                                       presented despite
the University rule and Mr. Loschiavo's instruction to the contrary.
There is no evidence more inflammatory than prior bad acts evidence, which
is why the criminal courts guard its admissibility so carefully. See Thomas v. State,
599 So. 2d                                                                              158, 162   (Fla. 1st DCA                                      1992) (reversing conviction and stating that

(precluding the admission of character evidence to prove action in conformity with
the charged act(s)); Billie v. State, 863 So. 2d 323, 326-27 (Fla. 3d DCA 2003).
None of the bad act/character evidence admitted against Mr. Corbin was
relevant to the incident on February 9, 2012, which was the only issue before the
Court.  Thus, the University violated its own rule and in doing so, rendered Mr.
Corbin's hearing irreversibly impaired as to the material issue of responsibility.
In a further deprivation of his due process right, the University denied Mr.
Corbin's request on appeal to rebut Ms.                                                                                                                                  's character/bad acts evidence with
                                                                                       newly discovered evidence, as permitted by Regulation 6C1-4.048(2)(c)(2). (Vol.
I-A at 188-89.)
2.                                                                                     The  University Put Before the Committee for
Consideration                                                                          Prejudicial   Documents                                                           and
Testimony   Pertaining   to   Civil   Injunction
Proceedings that the University Simultaneously
Ruled Irrelevant to the Conduct Hearing.
In addition to the character evidence detailed above, the University,
seemingly on its own accord, submitted to the Committee for review Ms.                 's
Petition for Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence, which she filed
in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit on February                                            18, 2012. (Vol. I-A at                                                            132-36.) The
Petition contains numerous character attacks and prior bad acts that were irrelevant
to the incident for which Mr. Corbin was charged. See id. at 133-34. Not only is
31

this evidence highly inflammatory, but when Mr. Corbin attempted to ask
questions of Ms.                                                                     about the injunction, Mr. Loschiavo cut him off, stating,
"We're going to move on because the injunction and the issues of the injunction
are not really what we're here to talk about."                                       (Vol. II at 265.) The inclusion of
highly inflammatory and irrelevant evidence in the record is inexplicable, and Mr.
Loschiavo's further decision to prevent Mr. Corbin from asking Ms.                   about it
constitutes a due process violation.
In sum, the improper admission by Ms.                                                of character evidence,
including evidence of prior bad acts, combined with Dean Loschiavo's limitations
on the admission of such evidence by Mr. Corbin, violated his due process right
and materially impaired the fairness of the proceedings below.
D.                                                                                   The Chair and Faculty Member of the Conduct Committee,
the Director of Student Conflict and Resolution, and the
Dean of Students Were Biased Against Mr. Corbin in
violation of his Right to Due Process.
In Regulation 6C1-4.042(6)(a) the Board of Regents makes clear that "[t]he
purpose and context of the student conduct process and sanctions imposed ... are
educational and not adversarial in nature." The administrative agency's role is to
act as facilitator without an interest in any particular outcome. Thus, by its own
rule, the University prohibits the agency from acting as a prosecutor, even an
impartial one. Yet, members of the Committee took a prosecutorial posture when
32

asking Mr. Corbin questions, which it did not take with Ms.                         . Moreover, the
Hearing facilitator, Chris Loschiavo, and the Dean of Students, who was
responsible for determining if Mr. Corbin was responsible for the charged conduct
and issuing a sanction, both displayed bias against Mr. Corbin.
1.                                                                                  The Chair and Faculty Members of the Conduct
Committee Acted as Prosecutors and Improperly
Accepted Ms.                                                                        's Evidence as True on Behalf
of the Committee Even Before the Hearing Had
Concluded.
This claim was not preserved below.  The record demonstrates that some of
the Committee members were biased against Mr. Corbin even before they heard all
of the evidence and, accordingly, acted as prosecutors rather than fair arbiters.
This bias is evident because first, members of the Committee asked questions of
Mr. Corbin in an accusatory tone or used their questions to make points about the
evidence. Second, on a couple of occasions, a member stated, for all other
members to hear, that the Committee was accepting Ms.                               's version of the
events.
As to the first category, one member asked Mr. Corbin about the hole in the
bottom of the bathroom door, which Mr. Corbin described as "very small." Ms.
Myers responded, "I've actually seen the pictures and that actually doesn't look
like minor cosmetic damage whatsoever in my opinion."                               (Vol. II at 323) When
33

Mr. Corbin conceded that he kicked the door, Ms. Myers added, "That sure sounds
angry." Id. at                                                                         326. Following some back-and-forth on the size of the hole, the
Chair stated, "Well, but the point I think we're making is ...                         [g]ranted it's a thin
piece of wood, but you                                                                 still would have had to exert some degree of force to
make a hole in the door. Id at 325 (emphasis added).
Subsequently,  when  investigator Mike Thompson was presenting the
Committee with a snapshot of the evidence he considered and reported that there
was some damage to one of the doors, but that it was the bedroom door, not the
bathroom door, the Chair responded, "No, we pretty much know that it was a
bathroom door."                                                                        (Vol. II at 377.)
Regarding a note Ms.                                                                                                                                     sent Mr. Corbin when she packed his belongings,
which the Committee apparently was not given, Mr. Corbin told the Committee he
thought it unlikely that a victim would "send handwritten notes about how bad they
want to fold your laundry one last time." Ms. Myers responded, sarcastically, "Are
you an extensive expert on victim behaviors?"                                          (Vol. II at 370.)
The second category of bias was demonstrated when the Chair asked Mr.
Corbin a question submitted by Ms.                                                     and simultaneously commented on the
reliability of the evidence pertaining to a critical issue in dispute: "On that same
34

morning when                                                                          went to take a shower, she locked the bathroom door—we've
already established that this happened."                                              (Vol. II at 352) (emphasis added).
Similarly, the Committee asked Mr. Corbin whether he was at the Southwest
Recreation Center on February 8, 2011, as Ms.                                         alleged because she believed
him to be following her. Mr. Corbin responded that he did not know, but that he
works out there. The Chair responded, "Her story that you were there, we'll accept
that." Id. at 323.
These comments and questions not only indicate a bias in favor of Ms.
and an unwillingness to consider all of the evidence before forming a conclusion
about Mr. Corbin's responsibility, they also carried particular weight because they
were offered by the only two non-student members of the Committee—the Chair
and Ms. Myers.4
2.                                                                                    The Director of Student Conflict and Resolution
and the Dean of Students Were Biased Against Mr.
Corbin and Should Have Recused Themselves from
Participation in His Proceedings.
This claim was preserved below in part.                                               (Vol. I-A at                                                187)   (asserting in

Ms. Myers' background is in mental health counseling and, specifically,
crisis intervention, http://www.arts.ufl.edu/bio.aspx?PID=253, so her assessment
likely would have been given even more weight by the student members of the
Committee, especially when she challenged Mr. Corbin's statement about what a

of the witnesses violated his right to due process); see also Vol. II at 244-5, 265-66
(Corbin's specific objections to refusals to ask questions). The remaining portion
of the claim, that internal University emails reveal Assistant Dean Loschiavo's and
Dean Shaw's bias against Mr. Corbin, relies on emails that were produced after the
proceedings below and are included in the Amended Record on Appeal. Because
Mr. Corbin had no way to know of their existence, and therefore no ability to raise
the claim below, he has not waived it for review by this Court, nor should the
claim be reviewed only for fundamental error.
Section                                                                                  120.665 of the Florida Statutes provides that an administrative
agency head may be disqualified for bias, prejudice, or interest. Charlotte County
v. IMC-Phosphates Co., 824 So. 2d 298, 300-01                                            (Fla. 1st DCA 2002) (reversing
final order of Superintendant of EPA where he made a statement in public, prior to
reviewing the appeal, lauding the decision of the administrative law judge below).
The test for determining bias worthy of recusal is "whether the facts alleged would
prompt a reasonably prudent person to fear that they will not obtain a fair and
impartial hearing." Id. at                                                               300                                                                     (citation omitted).  This Court also has applied
another standard, first enunciated in Bay Bank & Trust Co. v. Lewis, 634 So. 2d
672 (Fla.                                                                                1st DCA 1994), requiring that the movant demonstrate "just cause" for
the removal of an agency head, as distinct from the standard used for removal of a
36

judge. See also § 120.665, Fla. Stat.
To be sure, an agency head may wear several hats: she may serve as
investigator, prosecutor and adjudicator in the same matter.  As this Court has
made clear, "this blending of roles does not, in and of itself, create an
unconstitutional risk of bias." Bay Bank & Trust,                                          634 So.                                           2d at 675          (citations
omitted). That said, the decision maker in an administrative proceeding must, at a
minimum, be impartial to satisfy the standard for due process. Id.                         (citing Cherry
Communications, Inc. v. Deason, 652 So. 2d 803, 804-805 (Fla.                              1995)) And, as
noted above, the University of Florida requires an even higher standard than the
courts for the agency representative's impartiality—that University officials be
non-adversarial.                                                                           Fla.  Admin.   Code   R.                          6C1-4.042(6)(a).   The   agency
representative's role at the hearing, filled in this case by Mr. Loschiavo, is to act as
facilitator without an interest in any particular outcome.
a.                                                                                         Based on Internal University Emails, Mr. Corbin
has  Both  the Belief of a Reasonably Prudent
Person  that He Did not Receive  a Fair and
Impartial Hearing and Just Cause for Vacating the
Final  Order  Below  and Remanding for  New
Proceedings.
The aforementioned bias and prejudice are demonstrated first by several
internal University emails between Mr. Loschiavo and Dean Shaw. Email
correspondence between them dated October 19, 2011, responding to a request for
37

a continuance from Mr. Corbin's attorney, Terry Silverman, so that both he and
Mr. Corbin's father could attend the conduct hearing, reads as follows:
LOSCHIAVO: This is what we are dealing with on this case. They are
getting on my last nerve, which isn't smart given I am hearing the
case.
SHAW                                                                                    I'm sorry — I know they are trying. I just had to have a
long conversation with our General Counsel regarding the student
with Larry last week. Help any knowing you aren't the only one? :)
LOSCHIAVO                                                                               They  are  serving  as  witnesses  not  advisors,
apparently they have had some direct interactions with                                  . I
remain a bit skeptical of this however but that is what Chase is telling
me. I am trying to out fair him. We'll see how that works out.
(Vol. I at 66-70) (emphasis added). This exchange demonstrates an intention by
Mr. Loschiavo to penalize Mr. Corbin for requesting continuances, a skepticism
about Mr. Corbin's veracity, and evidence that Mr. Losciavo assumed an
adversarial role against Mr. Corbin by trying to "out fair" him. See also id. at 73-4
(telling Mr. Corbin's attorney he's not sure how important his and Mr. Corbin's
father's testimony will be).
On December                                                                             7,                                                         2012, Dean  Shaw received  an email  from Mandy
Hambelton, Assistant Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution,
informing Dean Shaw that Ms. Hambelton had provided the voicemails Mr. Corbin
left on Michael Hengelbrok's phone, "for your listening pleasure." Dean Shaw
then wrote to Mr. Loschiavo after accessing them: "Went and listened to some of
38.

his closing statement. "'I've never been a violent person.' Hello-voice mail?!" Mr.
Loschiavo then wrote back that the comment "[m]ade me laugh."                             (Vol.                                                                1-A at
180-82.) This exchange demonstrates that neither Dean Shaw nor Mr. Loschiavo
treated the proceedings with the seriousness they deserved, mocking Mr. Corbin in
a manner that confirms their adversarial posture against him.5
b.                                                                                        Assistant  Dean  Loschiavo   Made  Numerous
Decisions Regarding the Evidence that Indicated A
Bias Against Mr. Corbin and Deprived Him of Due
Process.
During the Conduct Hearing, Mr. Loschiavo made evidentiary decisions that
disadvantaged Mr. Corbin and seemed to have no rational basis. For example, Mr.
Loschiavo, of his own accord, following a long discussion during investigator
Mike Thompson's testimony regarding whether Mr. Corbin was accusing Officer
Armstrong of filing a false police report, instructed that the prejudicial police
reports be admitted into evidence for the Committee's reference, though the reason
is inaudible. (Vol. II at 380-82.)
5                                                                                         The appropriate avenue for addressing such bias or prejudice would
normally be to file a motion to recuse the offending administrator and, if denied, to
file an interlocutory Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the District Court of Appeal.
See Charlotte County v. IMC-Phosphates Co.,                                               824 So.                                                              2d 298 (Fla.   1st DCA
2002). But because Mr. Corbin only learned of the emails on appeal while working
with the University's. Clerk to compile the Amended Record, his only recourse
now is to respectfully request that the Court reverse the lower tribunal's final order
and remand for a new hearing based on a reasonable belief that he did not receive a
fair and impartial hearing or appeal.
39

By contrast, Mr. Corbin sought to introduce through investigator Mike
Thompson a note that Ms.                                                               left for him when she packed his clothes, stating
that she wanted to fold his clothes "one last time." Id. at 343-44. When asked why
he did not submit the note in advance, he told the Committee he did—apparently,
the copy received by the University was not legible, but no one informed him of
this. Id at 369-70. The record demonstrates that he did in fact send the note to the
University via email. (Vol. I-A at 37.) Despite the obvious relevance of the note,
the Committee members' interest in it as evidenced by numerous questions about
it, id. at 345-46, and Ms.                                                             's admission that she wrote it to Mr. Corbin, Vol. II
at                                                                                     360, Mr. Loschiavo refused to let Mr. Corbin admit it for the Committee's
review. (Vol. II at 370.)
Mr. Loschiavo and the Chair of the Committee also prevented Mr. Corbin
from asking several relevant questions of the witnesses. Administrative Code Rule
4.042                                                                                  (7)                                                                         (a) provides, "The charged student ... shall have the right ...   (iii) to
present questions to be asked of any witness who is present at the hearing by the
administrator conducting the hearing or the chair of the hearing body." No such
rule permits the complainant to ask questions; yet, Mr. Corbin's questions were
inexplicably limited and altered, while Ms. Park was essentially given free rein to
question the witnesses.
40

                                                                                         Mr. Corbin submitted in writing 67 questions to be asked of Ms.   when
she testified.                                                                           (Vol. I-A at                                                      167-171.) Mr. Loschiavo and/or the Chair6 prevented
him from asking or reworded 15 of those. The most prejudicial are as follows.
While  Mr.  Corbin  was  prevented  from accessing his apartment or
possessions, Ms.                                                                         left numerous photographs on his computer that can only be
described as provocative. See Supp. Rec. at 426-27, 432-42. The Chair changed the
language of Mr. Corbin's 46th question, "Specifically, did you take photographs of
yourself and leave them on the computer for me to locate once it was returned to
me?" Id. at 169 (emphasis added). The Chair instead asked: "[D]id you retain his
computer' and use it to store photographs of yourself on the computer?" (Vol. II at
259-60.) Mr. Corbin certainly had the right to establish for the Committee that she
left them therefor him to find, thus demonstrating either that she still had affection
for him after alleging he raped her, or, at the very least, wanted to taunt him.
                                                                                         Next, Mr. Corbin wanted to ask Ms.                                                                                      if she was aware of the polygraph
test that he passed                                                                      (Vol. II at                                                       170, Question                                         51; Vol. I-A at                     97-98), yet Mr.
6 The record gives some indication that one of Mr. Loschiavo's roles at the
hearing was to vet the questions from each party before giving them to the Chair to
ask; thus, even when Mr. Loschiavo is not explicitly on the record rejecting some
of the omitted questions, he likely did so on behalf of the Chair.
This portion of the question is taken from Questions 44-5 asking Ms.
whether she retained and used Mr. Corbin's computer over a period of days and
weeks when his attorney was trying to recover it for Mr. Corbin. (Vol. 2 at 169.)
Thus, Mr. Corbin does not object to it.
41

Loschiavo stated, for no apparent reason, "We're not asking questions about the
polygraph. You'll have a chance to address that in your statement."                      (Vol. II at
263.)
Perhaps the most egregious example was the compilation of three questions
submitted by Mr. Corbin into one:                                                        1) "Did you at some time early in this case
accuse my lawyer, Terry Silverman, of attempting to bribe you and pay you to
drop the charges?"                                                                       2) Did you advise the administration at the University of
Florida that my lawyer was attempting to bribe you?" and 3) "Did you withdraw
your allegations against Mr. Silverman and advise the [U]niversity that, in fact, he
did not ever attempt to bribe you?" (Vol. I-A at 171.) The last question, the only
one that specifically would have called into question Ms.                                's credibility, not
just as to the allegations against Mr. Silverman, but as to the accuracy of any of her
testimony, reports to the police and Narrative, was never asked. To add insult to
injury, the answer and objection to the question crafted by the Chair or Assistant
Dean were so inaudible that prejudice cannot be assessed:
COMMITTEE CHAIR: Can you describe-this is, again, a question
from Chase, can you describe-although we've rephrased it a little bit,
quite a bit-can you describe for us some of the communications that
you had with Terry Silverman, Chase's attorney in the injunction, and
I guess what were some of the things that went back and forth
between you and him? Did you ever make any accusations against
him, that kind of thing? Can you talk about that a little bit?
42

: Yes, there were several times he would try to pull me aside
and ask to talk to me privately. I have never spoken to him privately
other than through email. I would never compose a message on my
own and send an email. It was either                                                   [inaudible] through Terry
[inaudible] from my                                                                    [inaudible] so I responded. Other than that, I
never accused him of anything. Again, all the [inaudible] email that he
sends Zach. I guess through the [inaudible] wanted to push back the
[inaudible] hearings knowing that I wasn't going to be home during
the summer for an opportunity that I could not pass up, which is
[inaudible]. The thing is I was so glad to get away. Secondly, the
email                                                                                  [inaudible] told me                                   [inaudible] email   [inaudible] that Terry
[inaudible] front bumper [inaudible] wanted everything to be over and
done with, and I didn't want to keep it going. So in order for me to
receive the money that he put damages on my car [inaudible] driving
it on the [inaudible].                                                                 [Inaudible], but I had to either not show up at the
hearing at all; the Student Conduct Hearing at all or if I did show up I
specifically had to say that Chase Corbin is not a threat to the
University of Florida. That was exactly [inaudible] from me
LASCHIAVO: You can't address [inaudible].
CORBIN: I would like to state an objection to the refusal to ask
[inaudible].
LASCHIAVO:                                                                             You can explain that.
(Vol. II at 265-66.)
Finally,  Mr.  Loschiavo omitted questions                                             60-67  over  Mr.  Corbin's
objection, id. at 266. These questions pertained to court proceedings in which Ms.
sought a preliminary injunction against Mr. Corbin. Among other things, he
sought to elicit the fact that Ms.                                                     did not produce any corroborating evidence
to substantiate her claim that he violated the injunction. Despite the fact that Ms.
43

's accusations from the Petition for Injunction were in the record, Mr.
Loschiavo cut off Mr. Corbin's line of questioning, stating, "the injunction and the
issues of the injunction are not really what we're here to talk about."                (Vol. II at
265.) Thus, the Committee had only the ruling in favor of an injunction and no
insight into how weak the evidence was that supported it.
The relevance of the aforementioned questions is clear, much of it going to
the central issue at the hearing—Ms.                                                   's credibility. Because this case rested on
a finding by the Committee that Ms.                                                    was more consistent and more believable
than Mr. Corbin, such omissions constituted a violation of Mr. Corbin's right to
due process and of the University's own regulation, thereby requiring reversal even
if the Court fails to find bias by Mr. Loschiavo's and Dean Shaw.
E.                                                                                     MR.  CORBIN HAS BEEN DENIED  DUE  PROCESS
BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY FAILED TO AUDIBLY
RECORD HIS HEARING.
1.                                                                                     A Defendant is Entitled to a New Proceeding
When the Record on Appeal is Incomplete, the
Record Cannot Be Reconstructed, the Incomplete
Portions Are Necessary for Thoughtful Review on
Appeal, and the Defendant Can Demonstrate that
They Prejudiced his Presentation of Claims.
In the case at bar, to the extent this Court may find that Mr. Corbin has not
demonstrated prejudice, Mr. Corbin's right to an appeal has been compromised
through no fault of his own because the transcript of the hearing is rife with
44

inaudible portions and the record is otherwise incomplete.
Where a complete transcript of lower tribunal proceedings is unavailable on
appeal and the omitted portions are necessary for the appellate court's review of
the proceedings, the court has no choice but to vacate the disposition and remand
for a new trial. Delap v. State, 350 So. 2d 462, 463 (Fla.                              1977); see also Lipman v.
State, 428 So.2d 733 (Fla. 1st DCA 1983).
In IICT v. State,                                                                       662 So.2d                   1034                 (Fla. 1st DCA   1995), the appeal of a
juvenile proceeding, this Court vacated the defendant's conviction where the court
reporting equipment malfunctioned and a transcript could not be reconstructed by
the parties. Similarly, in Johnson v. State, 442 So. 2d                                 193 (Fla.                   1983), the Supreme
Court remanded to the trial court so the parties could attempt to reconstruct a
record on appeal that "was discovered to be virtually incomprehensible because of
omissions, ... misspellings, and obvious inaccuracies in either the recording or the
transcription of the trial." Johnson, 442 So. 2d at 195. The parties and stenographer
were able to reconstruct the record and the trial court found the corrected
transcripts contained "no significant or material fault                                 [nor] even one
prejudicial omission or error." Id. On appeal, the court refused to vacate the
Defendant's conviction because he was "unable to point to any omission,
inconsistency or inaccuracy which prejudice[d] the presentation of his case. Id.;
45

see also, White v. State of Fla. Dept. of Corr., 939 F.2d 912, 914 (11th Cir.          1991)
(appeal denied where defendant could not prove defect in transcripts caused undue
prejudice); Darling v. State, 808 So. 2d 145, 163 (Fla. 2002) (same).
Thus, the operative questions when a transcript on appeal is incomplete is
whether the missing portions are necessary for the court's complete review of the
claims  on  appeal  and  whether  the  omissions  prejudiced  the  defendant's
presentation of his claims.
2.                                                                                     The Amended Record on Appeal Is So Incomplete
and Inaccurate that the Court Cannot Complete a
Full Review of Mr. Corbin's Claims.
Mr. Corbin's Student Conduct hearing below was audio recorded pursuant to
Regulation 6C1-4.042(7)(b). The complainant,                                           appeared by speaker
phone. (Vol. II at 202, 205.) Counsel for the parties had several email exchanges in
an effort to ensure that the record was complete and accurate for the Court's
review. The remaining omissions could not be rectified by either party. Thus, "the
parties agree that the transcription provided for the Court is the most complete
transcription that they can collectively provide for review on appeal."                (Joint
Stipulation at 1-2.) There remain numerous inaudible portions or portions not
transcribed accurately and several relevant documents are missing from the
Record.

                                                                                     significant portions of the testimony are reported as "inaudible" or make so little

throughout Ms.                                                                                                                                                             's statements and testimony 270 times. For example, in her
opening statement, Ms.                                                               testified,
Yes,                                                                                 [inaudible]. So I'm fast forwarding to we moved in
together in August. I hadn't wanted to live with him, but again that's
where I was going because I didn't have anybody and I didn't want to
live with him [inaudible], but I did not want to be with him.
(Vol. II at 208.) Her description of the incident for which Mr. Corbin was charged
is equally unintelligable:
I just jumped out of the shower trying to get the phone from
him because if he kept looking through my phone it was going to
anger him more [inaudible] intimate                                                  When I jumped out of the
shower I went right to him. He had left the bathroom door and then I
was trying to get my phone from him again so [inaudible] he would
either hold it above my head and slap my arms down, or [inaudible]
trying to get it from him                                                            I jumped back into the shower, I walked
into the bathroom, was about to lock the bathroom door. I got into the
shower and I couldn't lock and shut the bathroom door. He followed
in after me                                                                          Then when he pushed me against the wall [inaudible]
the other side [inaudible] push, I asked him to stop and I pushed him
away. Eventually [inaudible] I just wanted to get out of there.
47

I then                                                                                    [inaudible] kissing me                                                [inaudible]. I just gave up                 I
still had shampoo in my hair. So I hurried and rinsed the shampoo out
of my hair [inaudible] get out of there. Like the closet—I just want to
clarify that-the bathroom                                                                 [inaudible] bedroom where I was sleeping
and he was sleeping on the futon out in the living room he said he
didn't agree to that and prior to                                                         [inaudible] bedroom he would
actually come in when the door was locked. [Inaudible] easy for him
to unlock the door from the outside. I [inaudible] and I didn't want
him coming in [inaudible] key and unlock it and come in bed with me.
Id. at 218-19.
In answer to whether she recalled returning some personal items to Mr.
Corbin, including a written note, she responded, "Yes[.]                                  [Inaudible] left the
apartment [inaudible]. I felt that a note was needed with those items                     [inaudible]
time. How can I still not care [inaudible]?" Id. at 260. See also id. at 263 (inaudible
statement regarding whether Mr. Corbin's attorney asked Ms.                               to produce
emails she claimed he sent her at the injunction hearing). As to their alleged sexual
,.
encounter in the shower, Ms.  t                                                           told the Committee the following:
                                                                                          He had [inaudible] last statement—he claimed that that there was no
                                                                                          sexual intercourse together in the shower. Even if it—I just don't
                                                                                          understand why he says there was none, but he's also saying--
[inaudible] doesn't                                                                       [inaudible]. Also, the phone that was                                 [inaudible]
                                                                                          that he knew that I did not want him to be with me                    Again in
reference to                                                                              [inaudible] I                                                         [inaudible] want to feel comfortable with
[inaudible] dating. I knew that I wanted to be                                            [inaudible] with him
because that's entirely not my purpose.
Id. at 410. Without the audible portions of these statements, it is impossible to
discern their substance on the very issue of Mr. Corbin's guilt. Indeed, in the
48

statement above regarding whether the intercourse was consensual, it is entirely
possible that Ms.                                                                      was entertaining the possibility that Mr. Corbin thought she
consented to sex, which would absolve him of responsibility.
b.                                                                                     Critical Pieces of Evidence Are Missing.
The Amended Record contains typed and handwritten copies of the
questions Mr. Corbin requested that the Committee ask Ms.                              and her witnesses
during the hearing, but not all of them. One stray page of questions starts with
number 16, with no preceding pages numbering back to                                   1, nor any indication of
whom the questions were for.                                                           (Vol. I-A at                                                     172.) Further, Ms.   's written
questions are not in the record at all. Because Mr. Corbin asserts herein that
Assistant Dean Loschiavo was biased against Mr. Corbin as demonstrated in part
by his refusal to ask some of Mr. Corbin's submitted questions, the missing
questions are central to an issue on appeal.
Third, the GPD recovered two poems from Mr. Corbin's apartment on the
date of the incident, a booklet (also referred to as a pamphlet) and a poem found on
the floor. (Vol. I at                                                                  10.) Det. Fair cited heavily to excerpts from one of the poems
in her investigative report, Vol. I at                                                 11, which was presented to the Committee to
demonstrate that Mr. Corbin knew he and Ms.                                            were no longer romantically
involved on Feb. 9, a fact that Mr. Corbin disputed. Despite this highly prejudicial
49

excerpt, and Det. Fair's assessment of the meaning of the poem, as well as that she
found the note "strange," Vol. II at                                                    289-91, neither poem was included in the
record.
For all of the foregoing reasons, if this Court determines it cannot review
Mr. Corbin's claim that there was insufficient evidence of his responsibility for the
charged acts of misconduct with any accuracy, it should remand for a new hearing
that is recorded and transcribed accurately.
CONCLUSION
Each of the claims presented herein forms a basis for reversal of the
University's final order in this case. When taken cumulatively, they amount to
numerous violations of Mr. Corbin's due process right and the University's failure
to meet its burden of proof regarding the off-campus nature of the charged acts
and the acts themselves. Thus, he respectfully asks that this Court reverse the
Order below and vacate the sanctions against him.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS
The present case is an appeal of a final decision entered by the University Of
Florida Board Of Trustees                                                               (the "University") on January   17, 2012, suspending
Chase Corbin ("Appellant") for one year for threatening and sexually assaulting a
female student ("the Victim"). (R. 193-195).1
Appellant contends that the University's decision was not based upon
substantial  competent  evidence,  that  the  University  applied  its  regulations
incorrectly, and that the University denied him due process. However, while
Appellant's alleged grievances are numerous, Appellant fails to cite the correct
legal standard for the reversal of the decision below and further fails to raise a
single instance of a material reversible error by the University.  The facts, which
'The University Of Florida Board Of Trustees is an institution of higher education
exercising powers derived directly from the Florida constitution and not subject to
the Administrative Procedure Act. Thus, as this Court and the 4th District Court of
Appeal have expressly held, jurisdiction in this case rests solely with the circuit
court via a petition for certiorari pursuant to Fla. Rule App. Pro. 9.190(b)(3).
Nonetheless, Appellant continues to pursue a judicial review of his case by this
Court. Accordingly, out of an abundance of caution, the University files this
Answer Brief (should this Court retain jurisdiction in the instant case) and requests
affirmance of its decision for the reasons set forth herein.

are largely conceded by Appellant, demonstrate the appropriateness and validity of
the University's decision in this matter.
A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On March                                                                                 18, 2011, the University initiated the underlying proceeding
against Appellant via a letter notifying Appellant that he was being charged with
violating three sections of the Student Conduct Code and was interimly suspended
from the University. (R. 29-30). Specifically, Appellant was charged with violating
sections                                                                                 4                                                                    (b) and 4(b)(2) (Sexual Assault and Misconduct) and 4(c) (Harassment
and Threats).                                                                            (R. 29-30). Appellant was further informed that he was required to
attend an informal meeting with Assistant Dean Loschiavo on March 24th in order
to have an opportunity to review the information the University received and to
discuss his rights, responsibilities and resolution options regarding the charges. (R.
29-30). On March 28th, shortly after Appellant attended the informal hearing, his
interim suspension was lifted to allow him to attend spring and summer classes
while his hearing was pending.                                                           (R.                                                                  34). The decision to temporarily lift the
suspension and trespass during the summer was reached because the Victim was
studying in Washington D.C. during that summer. (R. 31-34).
Appellant's next communication with the University occurred on April 20th,
when he submitted a list of witnesses and evidence that he planned to introduce at
2

his hearing. (R. 37). On September 19th, Appellant informed the University that he
had chosen to have his case reviewed by the Student Conduct Committee. (R. 59-
62). On October 5th, the Victim submitted a list of documents and questions that
she wished to have introduced at the hearing. (R. 63-66).
On October 19th, Appellant was informed that the hearing date was set for
Nov 3rd. (R. 76). Furthermore, the notice of the hearing provided a detailed list of
information and witnesses to be introduced by him and against him and provided
Appellant with an opportunity to review the list and make any corrections as
necessary.                                                                             (R.                         74-76). The notice provided that Appellant could amend the list
provided that he informed Asst. Dean Loschiavo at least 48 hours prior to the
hearing of the modification.                                                           (R.                         74). Appellant quickly sought to postpone the
hearing because of scheduling conflicts. (R. 68-69). The University agreed to the
request, and the hearing was postponed until Dec 2nd. (R. 85).
At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellant was found responsible for
violating all three charged University regulations. (R.                                159). The Student Conduct
Committee recommended that Appellant be suspended from Spring 2012 through
the Spring 2013 semester, that he be forbidden from contacting the Victim, and
that he meet with a counselor to discuss sexual violence and anger management.

(R.                                                                                   160). Dean Jen Day  Shaw accepted the  Student Conduct Committee's
recommendations and issued a decision. (R. 183-184).
On  Dec.                                                                              22nd,  Appellant  appealed  the  Dean's  decision pursuant to
University regulations.                                                               (R.                                                                          186). Appellant alleged that the requirements of
University of Florida Regulation                                                                                                                           4.041   (2)                                                (d)  charging him with off-campus
conduct were not met; that Asst. Dean Loschiavo was biased against him, and that
he was unlawfully denied the ability to ask certain questions of the Victim.          (R.
187-188). Appellant further alleged that the findings were not supported by a
preponderance of the evidence and that the sanctions imposed were improper. (R.
188-190). On January                                                                  17, 2012, Appellant was informed that the University was
upholding its decision.                                                               (R.                                                                  162).   Thereafter, Appellant sought review by this
Court.
B. FACTS RELEVANT TO THE ISSUES ON APPEAL
On February 9, 2011, Appellant made four phone calls in a fifteen minute
period from the Victim's phone to Michael Hengelbrok (the Victim's boyfriend).
(R. lb). After each phone call, Appellant left a voice message, in which the Victim
can be heard screaming in distress in the background. (R. 424). In one message, the
Victim can be heard begging and pleading for Appellant to get off of her. (R. 424).
In another message, Appellant can be heard telling Mr. Hengelbrok, "listen to me

                                                                                                                                        think she's mine why don't you ask her who she was with this morning, who she
let inside of her, bitch."                                                              (R.                                             1,423-424). Immediately upon listening to these voice
                                                                                        messages, Mr. Hengelbrok called 911. (R. lb).
                                                                                        In response to the                              911 call, the Gainesville Police Department                                     ("GPD")
                                                                                        dispatched officers to the apartment.           (R.                                                                             1 a). Upon entering the apartment, an
officer found the Victim sitting on the floor of the living room and crying. (R. lb).
The Victim told GPD that she had been sexually assaulted by Appellant upon
returning to the apartment they shared to check on her pets and take a shower
before attending classes. (R. lb, 7). The Victim had been living with Appellant for
six months, despite having ended her relationship with Appellant two months prior,
because she was financially able to move to a different apartment. (R. la, 6). She
had become increasingly afraid of Appellant and had spent the last three days
living with Mr. Hengelbrok. (R. lb, 7).
Upon arriving at her apartment that morning, the Victim was met by
Appellant, who was wearing only a jacket. (R. 7). Appellant attempted to give the
Victim a poem indicating his desire for her to return to him, but the Victim
rebuffed his requests, and proceeded to enter the bathroom to take a shower. (R. 7).
The Victim closed and locked the bathroom door, and left her cell phone in the
5

bedroom behind her. (R. 7). While the Victim was in the shower, Appellant gained
access to her phone and read her messages to and from Mr. Hengelbrok, which
sent him into a jealous rage.                                                            (R. lb,                                                                            7-8). Enraged, Appellant started hitting the
                                                                                         bathroom door forcefully and shouting at the Victim. (R. lb, 7). When the Victim
                                                                                         refused to respond or open the door, Appellant kicked the bathroom door open and
entered the bathroom.                                                                    (R.  lb,                                                                           7). Appellant continued to behave violently,
                                                                                         screaming at the Victim and calling her a "whore."                                 (R.  lb,                                                7).  Scared of
Appellant's demeanor, the Victim exited the shower with shampoo in her hair to
try to calm down Appellant. (R. lb, 7). Appellant continued to call the Victim a
whore and accosted her about her relationship with Mr. Hengelbrok. (R. lb, 7).
The Victim, fearful of Appellant, tried to re-enter the shower to rinse her hair and
leave the apartment.                                                                     (R. lb,                                                                            7). As she started to frantically rinse off her hair,
Appellant disrobed, followed her into the shower and pinned her against the wall
from behind. (R. lb, 8). The Victim begged him to stop and leave her alone, but
despite her pleas, Appellant continued to hold her pinned against the wall and
forcibly penetrated her with his penis. (R. 1 b, 8). Pinned, scared and exhausted, the
Victim did not physically struggle. (R. lb, 8).
After some time, Appellant exited the shower.                                            (R.                                                                                8). After he left, the
Victim also exited the shower, ran to the closet and attempted to get dressed in
order to leave. (R. 8). Appellant did not permit her to leave; and instead followed
6

her into the closet with her phone in his hand, continuing to scream obscenities at
her and preventing her from leaving or retrieving her phone.                           (R.   8). Appellant
made the phone calls that prompted the 911 calls during this time. (R. 8). In one
message, the Victim can be heard screaming and crying "Give me my phone.
(crying) Give me my phone. Stop it!," while Appellant is shouting "Mike! Mike!
Mike! Mike!"                                                                           (R.   424). The next message consists of Appellant telling Mr.
Hengelbrok to stay away from the Victim, and that Appellant had entered her
sexually that morning. (R. 8, 424). Thereafter, Appellant refocused his attention on
the Victim, who was crawling out of the closet into the living room. (R. la, 8).
After knocking her down onto the ground repeatedly, Appellant threw a rope over
the side of the loft of their apartment and told the Victim that he would die if she
would not be with him. (R. 8). He then brandished a knife and asked the Victim if
she wanted him to go to jail, because he would fight Hengelbrok now.                   (R.   8).
Appellant continued to yell and shout threats and obscenities in this manner until
the police arrived (R. 8).
In her interview with the police, and later during her testimony at the
Student Conduct Committee hearing, the Victim recounted other occasions on
which Appellant was physically violent towards her. (R. 8, 211-215). The Victim
stated that Appellant was physically and emotionally abusive, and since the end of
their relationship, he took pleasure in pushing sexually inappropriate boundaries
7

with her. (R. 211-219). Specifically, he would repeatedly touch her,  despite her
efforts to push him away and ask him to stop, and he would enjoy her struggle. (R.
219).
When interviewed by GPD, Appellant denied having sexually assaulted the
Victim. (R. lb, 6). Appellant claimed that the Victim had fainted in the shower and
he was merely assisting her, after which point he argued with her about Mr.
Hengelbrok.                                                                              (R. lb,                                             6). However, at the Student Conduct Committee Hearing,
Appellant admitted that he left the voice message on Mr. Hengelbrok's phone
stating that he sexually penetrated the Victim that morning. (R. 334).
After GPD concluded interviewing the Victim and Appellant, they arrested
Appellant for sexual assault.                                                            (R.  la). After the arrest, GPD collected various
evidence around the apartment, including the voice messages recorded on Mr.
Hengelbrok's phone, the poem prepared for the Victim by Appellant, in which he
expresses his desire to have her back and states that he is not ready to lose her, and
pictures of the apartment and the injuries on the Victim. (R. 3,6,9-11). The poem is
noteworthy because Appellant admits that his temper was responsible for their
breakup. (R. 10-11).

On February 18th, the Victim filed a petition for a protective order from
domestic violence, listing Appellant as the respondent; the petition was granted.
(R.                                                                                     19-23).
As noted above, the underlying proceeding was initiated on March 18, 2011.
(R.                                                                                     29-37,                                                          59-66). When Appellant was informed of his original hearing date of
November 3rd, Appellant's attorney immediately replied that neither he nor
Appellant's father would be able to attend at that date and asked for another delay
of the hearing.                                                                         (R.                                                             68-69). Asst. Dean Loschiavo expressed frustration with this
latest delay in a series of events that had pushed the duration of the proceedings to
eight months at that point, to Dean Jen Day Shaw, saying that "[he] literally just
sent the hearing schedule notice out minutes before [Appellant's attorney's letter
asking for a different date]. To GPD and the alleged victim we look like we don't
know what we are doing                                                                  "                                                               (R.                                                                   68). In granting the request for delay, Asst.
Dean Loschiavo replied to Appellant's attorney that "as far as Chase has made him
aware, neither                                                                          [Mr. Silverman nor TJ Corbin] have knowledge of what occurred
that night, which is what the hearing is about so I don't know how important your
information will be (I am not saying it isn't important but I want to emphasize that
the hearing is about what occurred the night in question) it is not about
[Appellant]'s character." (R. 74).  The hearing began on December 2, 2011, with
the Victim's opening statement. (R. 207). After the Victim concluded her opening
9

statement, the Committee members asked her questions. (R. 228-244). Next, Asst.
Dean Loschiavo asked the Victim questions submitted by Appellant. Of the 67
questions Appellant submitted, 49 were asked as requested, eight were not asked
because  the  Victim  had  already  addressed them  in her opening  statement
(questions 1-7, 9), six were not asked because they were irrelevant (question 8, 51,
60-63), one question was reworded in an immaterial way (question 46), and three
were combined into one question preserving the essence of the originals (questions
64-66). (R. 244-266).
GPD officer, Cpl. Armstrong, was called to testify next.                               (R.   269). Cpl.
Armstrong's testimony was consistent with the report he filed in February.             (R.
269-278). Another GPD officer, Det. Fair, also gave testimony consistent with her
report. (R. 278-292). Additionally, she answered questions prepared by Appellant,
including questions regarding polygraph testing, Appellant's polygraph results and
the charges that were dropped against him. (R. 293-301). In particular, Det. Fair
indicated that around the time Appellant's criminal charges were pending before
the State Attorney, the State Attorney's office dropped a high number of cases that
GPD believed should have been pursued, including the charges against Appellant.
(R. 298).
Next, Mr. Silverman testified at the request of Appellant. Mr. Silverman
testified about the Victim's allegations of improper e-mail contact made at the
10

injunction hearing and the investigation by Mr. Thompson, Appellant's hired
private investigator, prior to the criminal charges being dropped. (R. 301-310). Mr.
Silverman's testimony essentially amounted to character evidence about Appellant
and the Victim. (R. 301-310).
Thereafter, Appellant made his opening statement, asserting he was not
angry, did not sexually assault the Victim, and initially made no mention of his
voice messages on Hengelbrok's phone.                                                  (R.          313-314). He suggested that the
Victim had framed him for sexual assault. (R. 314). Appellant further denied most
of the Victim's allegations and put forth an alternative account of events in which
he cast himself as a victim of a vengeful woman and her secret boyfriend. (R. 314-
323). However, when the Committee started to ask him questions about his
                                                                                                    account of events, strong inconsistencies arose.                                        (R.                                              326-358). For example,
                                                                                                    Appellant stated in his narrative that he was not angry, but when pressured to
                                                                                                    answer about the damaged door, he admitted that he kicked it because he was
                                                                                                    upset. (R. 326). Further, he stated that Det. Fair's excerpted poem was not the right
                                                                                                    poem, and that he did not end his poem with "I love you                                                                                  ; I'm not ready to
lose you, Chase,                                                                       02/09/11."   (R.                                                                                     328). This statement directly contradicts Det.
                                                                                                    Fair's official police report made on the day of the initial arrest.                                                                     (R.                      11).
Furthermore, Appellant alleged that he did not say anything to GPD officers, again
contradicting the police report.                                                       (R.          330-331). Perhaps most incredibly, Appellant
11

first claimed he left a message in which he simply told Hengelbrok to stay away
from the Victim, and that she had wanted him inside her that morning, but he was
not able to enter her.                                                                   (R.                             334-335). However, when the Committee replayed the
voice message in question, Appellant admitted to having said that he had entered
the Victim, but alleged that he left that message "out of a little bit of jealousy and
anger that . . .                                                                         [Victim] wanted him instead."   (R. 334-335). The Committee further
asked questions of Appellant about nearly every piece of testimony and allegation
made against him up until that point, ranging from various details of the events
surrounding the sexual assault to the nature of his relationship with the Victim
prior to the sexual assault.                                                             (R.                             330- 358). In most of these instances, Appellant's
account was inconsistent with the physical condition of the apartment and the
Victim's physical and emotional state, was not corroborated by the information
presented, or directly contradicted the police reports. (R. 326-358).                    After                           the
Committee was finished with their questions for Appellant, Mr. Thompson was
called in to testify.                                                                    (R.                             372). He was asked to summarize his investigation on
behalf of Appellant, his findings, and what documents or interviews he based his
findings on.                                                                             (R.                             373-388).  Mr.  Thompson testified that the  entirety of his
investigation consisted of interviewing Appellant, and then contacting six people at
Appellant's request for a character reference, two of whom did not respond. (R.
379). Furthermore, Mr. Thompson revealed that he had not entered the apartment,
12

had not examined the scene of the assault at any point after the assault, and based
his assessment solely on pictures of the apartment. (R. 379). Mr. Thompson also
confirmed that he never got to talk to the Victim, or investigate any physical marks
on her.                                                                                    (R.             379). After Mr. Thompson's testimony was concluded, Appellant's
father TJ Corbin presented his testimony. (R. 389). His testimony focused on his
perception of Appellant and the Victim's relationship, Appellant's character and
temperament and the  effect of the Victim's  ethnicity  on her character for
truthfulness. (R. 390-405).
After TJ Corbin's testimony, Asst. Dean Loschiavo read Joel Hackman's
affidavit, which consisted of character information against the Victim and in favor
of Appellant.                                                                              (R.             406). To conclude, the Victim made her closing statement,
followed by Appellant's closing statement.                                                 (R. 407-421).
SCOPE OF JURISDICTION
Pursuant to this Court's decision in May 2012, jurisdiction in this matter lies
solely with the 8th Circuit Court via a petition for certiorari. Decker v. University of
Florida,                                                                                   85 So.3d 571    (Fla.                                                             1st DCA 2012), (see also: Couchman v. University of

STANDARD OF REVIEW
When reviewing  quasi-judicial  orders of agencies not subject to the
Administrative Procedure Act, the scope of the Court's review is limited to "(1)
whether procedural due process is accorded; (2) whether the essential requirements
of law have been observed; and                                                        (3) whether the administrative findings and
judgment  are  supported by  competent  substantial  evidence."                                                                                          Haines  City
Community Development v. Heggs ,                                                      658 So.2d                                     523,   530   (Fla.   1995); City of
Deerfield Beach v. Vaillant, 419 So.2d 624 (Fla. 1982).
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
This appeal presents one central issue to the Court: whether the University
acted properly in suspending Appellant for threatening and sexually assaulting a
female  student.  Appellant alleges that the University violated his rights  at
numerous steps of the proceedings; however, the record below easily illustrates
that the contrary is true; the University provided Appellant with due process and a
fair hearing.
Appellant's three contentions are that the University's decision is not based
on competent substantial evidence, that the University misapplied or violated its
own regulations regarding Student Conduct Hearings, and that the University
denied Appellant due process by not providing proper notice and a fair hearing.
14

First,  the  Court  should  affirm  the  University's  decision  suspending
Appellant, because the record below contains sufficient competent substantial
evidence which a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a
conclusion  that  Appellant  sexually  assaulted  and  threatened  the  Victim..
Furthermore, the record below is sufficiently accurate and complete to permit the
Court to perform a full review.
Second, the University applied the correct law and properly afforded
Appellant due process. The University complied with the law by following its
regulations regarding witness statements and admissibility of information during
the hearing.
Third, Appellant was given prompt and proper notice in full accordance with
University regulations and requirements, and was fully afforded due process.
Last, Appellant was provided with a fair hearing and afforded due process.
For all the foregoing reasons the Court should affirm the University's
decision.
15

ARGUMENT
1. THE  UNIVERSITY'S  DECISION  WAS  BASED  ON  COMPETENT
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, AND THE RECORD BELOW CONTAINS
EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO AFFIRM THE DECISION.
In the present appeal, Appellant alleges that the University's decision was
not based on competent substantial evidence; further Appellant alleges that the
record below is insufficiently complete to reach the merits on appeal. Appellant's
allegations are based on a misunderstanding of the applicable legal standard, and
further, Appellant misapplies the law even when he quotes it correctly.   The
University reached its decision on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence,
meaning that the University found it more likely that Appellant sexually assaulted
the Victim than not. Univ. of Florida Reg.                                            4.042   (8). However the standard of
review for the evidence in the present appeal is whether said decision was based on
competent substantial evidence, which is a lower standard than preponderance of
the evidence, and Appellant does not allege that any information relied upon by the
University failed to meet such standard. Branham v. TMG Staffing Services, 994
So.2d                                                                                 1172    (Fla.                          1st DCA   2008). On the contrary, there is no shortage of
information that meets the competent substantial evidence standard.
16

Finally, Appellant's allegation that the University bears the burden of
providing a complete record is incorrect. Even if the University was responsible for
furnishing a complete record, Appellant mischaracterizes the completeness of the
record as a question of due process.
A.                                                                                     THE                                     UNIVERSITY'S     DECISION   FINDING   APPELLANT
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS BASED ON COMPETENT
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHICH A REASONABLE MIND WOULD
ACCEPT AS ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A CONCLUSION.
The Court should review questions of fact in the present case only to
determine  whether  the  University's  decision  was  supported  by  competent
substantial evidence. Haines  City Cmty.  Dev.,                                        658  So.2d at                           523.  However,
Appellant misapplies the law and asks the Court to review the facts of this case de
novo, rather than claiming that the evidence relied on by the University fails to
meet the  competent  substantial  evidence  standard.  On  the  contrary,  when
determining whether the University's decision was based on competent substantial
evidence, the Court "will not undertake to re-weigh or evaluate the evidence
presented before the tribunal or agency whose order is under examination".  De
Groot v. Sheffield, 95 So. 2d 912, 916 (Fla.                                           1957). Instead the Court will look to
whether there exists competent substantial evidence on the record. Competent
substantial evidence is evidence which is relevant evidence that ". . . a reasonable
17

mind would accept as adequate to  support a conclusion". Id.  Furthermore,
Idleterminations regarding the weight of the evidence or the credibility of
witnesses are peculiarly within the province of the finder of fact and will not be
disturbed on appeal." Southwin, Inc. v. Verde, 806 So. 2d 586, 588 (Fla. 3d DCA
2002), citing M.A.B. v. Department of Health & Rehabilitative Servs., 630 So.2d
1252,                                                                                 1254 (Fla.   1st DCA 1994).
Finally, competent substantial evidence is not necessarily evidence that
would have been admissible in a criminal or civil court; the competent substantial
evidence  standard  is  specifically  meant to  accommodate the  fact that "in
administrative  proceedings  the  formalities  in the  introduction  of testimony
common to the courts of justice are not strictly employed". DeGroot v. Sheffield,
95 So.2d, at 916.
The University's decision was based on a slew of competent substantial
evidence. The Student Conduct Committee, in its role as the finder of fact in
Appellant's hearing, reviewed relevant information about Appellant's sexual
assault on the Victim, and determined that Appellant had committed sexual assault
and threatened the Victim. The information reviewed by the Committee supports
the University's determination that Appellant sexually assaulted and threatened the
Victim.
18

The  record  on  appeal  contains  extensive  information  to  support the
Committee's decision. In particular, the information cited by the Student Conduct
Committee in their findings is sufficient for a reasonable mind to support the
conclusion that Appellant sexually assaulted the Victim.
On the charge that Appellant threatened the Victim, the Committee based its
findings on the fact that Appellant kicked in the door and put a hole in it while
yelling  profanities  at  the  Victim,  and  left  threatening  voice  messages  on
Hengelbrok's phone.                                                                    (R.   159). Since the Court should accept the Committee's
finding of reliability and trustworthiness of the information, the Court should give
the information the same credibility as the Committee. Kicking and damaging the
bathroom door to gain access to the Victim is sufficient information for a
reasonable person to infer that the Victim was threatened. The voice messages
further solidify the  strength  of the  information  supporting the University's
decision. Specifically, the messages in which the Victim is pleading for Appellant
to get off her and the message in which Appellant threatens Hengelbrok, warning
him to get away from the Victim or else, provide even more reliable information
showing Appellant exhibited threatening conduct.
On the charge of sexual assault, the Committee cited the police report,
Appellant's inconsistent testimony, the Victim's extensive testimony about the
assault on numerous occasions, Appellant's forceful entry into the bathroom, and
19

Appellant's angry comments towards the Victim and Hengelbrok before and after
the assault as the primary evidence used in their decision.                           (R.   159). Again, the
Committee accepted the Victim's testimony as more reliable, and took note of the
inconsistencies in Appellant's testimony. In his testimony, Appellant implies that
the police reports and the testimony of Ofc. Armstrong are false or wrong, that the
Victim is entrapping him, and that he is simply too good of a person to sexually
assault someone. It is evident that the Committee found that aspects of Appellant's
testimony and other information offered in support of his peaceful nature were not
reliable, and the Court should not re-weigh the credibility of witnesses on appeal.
Furthermore, while Appellant attempted to argue that he never actually
penetrated the Victim, in the voice message he left on Hengelbrok's phone he
spitefully states "[i]f you don't think she's mine why don't you ask her who she
was with this morning, who she let insider of her, bitch". (R. 423).
As discussed above, the record is replete with evidence supporting the
finding that Appellant sexually assaulted the Victim. A reasonable mind looking at
the information in this case would accept the information as more than adequate to
support the conclusion of the Committee.
20

B.  THE  RECORD  BELOW  IS  SUFFICIENTLY  COMPLETE  AND
ACCURATE  TO  PERMIT  THE  COURT  TO  COMPLETE  A  FULL
REVIEW,   AND   THE   RECORD   SUPPORTS   THE   UNIVERSITY'S
DECISION.
Appellant appeals on both factual and procedural grounds. The record on
appeal is complete as to all documents and procedural history, and Appellant does
not argue the contrary. Rather, the only contention is that the transcript of the
hearing is too incomplete for a review. The transcript of the hearing is only
relevant to Appellant's contention that the University's decision was not based on
competent substantial evidence.
The burden is on the Appellant to show reversible error; when Appellant
fails to demonstrate reversible error because the record is incomplete or missing,
the Court will generally affirm the tribunal's decision. See Applegate v. Barnett
Bank of Tallahassee, 377 So.2d 1150 (Fla.                                            1979) (Affirming the decision below,
holding that party which appealed the trial court's decision, but did not bring
forward any substitute for a trial transcript did not furnish an adequate record
demonstrating reversible error); Pan American Metal Products Co. v. Healy,           138
So.2d 96 (Fla. 3d DCA 1962) (affirming the decision below, holding that the Court
cannot find reversible error when the record is too incomplete to support it). The
exceptions cited by Appellant are criminal law cases in which a particular statute
21

mandates that the record must be available in its entirety on appeal. See Lipman v.
State, 428 So.2d 733 (Fla.                                                            1st DCA 1983) (opinion ordering a new trial in death
penalty appeal, because the Appeals Court is mandated by statute to review based
on the entire record).
Furthermore, "[i]n proceedings seeking review of administrative action not
governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, the clerk of the lower tribunal shall
not be required to prepare a record or record index. The petitioner or appellant
shall submit an appendix in accordance with rule 9.220."  Fla. R. App. P. 9.190.
The University is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the record on
appeal. If Appellant believes the record is too incomplete to permit him to show
reversible error, then this Court should affirm the University's decision.
Moreover, the record is practically complete. Any inaudible portions are
immaterial and amount to less than one percent of the transcript. Moreover, nearly
every [inaudible] can be easily inferred by context or is irrelevant to the overall
meaning of the sentence, as can be seen in the record; for example, the Victim
states in her testimony that "[Appellant] pulled                                      [inaudible] KA-BAR, which is a
knife he received from his wrestling coach", in which case it is very easy to infer
that the Victim is stating that Appellant pulled out or brandished his knife.         (R.
211).
22

The real point of relevance is whether the record, as is, contains competent
substantial evidence to support the decision below. As discussed above, the
transcript does in fact successfully demonstrate the existence of competent
substantial evidence to support the University's decision, and thus the record is
complete and accurate.
2.                                                                                     THE  UNIVERSITY  PROPERLY  AFFORDED  APPELLANT  DUE
PROCESS.
Beyond questions of fact, the Court's review of the University's decision
suspending Appellant is limited to whether "(1) . . . procedural due process is
accorded; (2) whether the essential requirements of law have been observed. . ."
Haines City Cmty. Dev., 658 So.2d 523, 530.
Appellant alleges that his right to due process was violated on four grounds;
first Appellant alleges that the University did not follow its regulations regarding
witness statements; second, Appellant alleges that the University allowed improper
information to be heard during the hearing; third, Appellant alleges that he did not
receive proper notice; and last, Appellant alleges that he did not receive a fair
hearing.
23

A.   THE   UNIVERSITY   COMPLIED   WITH   ITS   REGULATIONS
REGARDING                                                                               THE                                                          INCLUSION   OF   A   WRITTEN   WITNESS
STATEMENT PROVIDED BY THE VICTIM.
Appellant alleges that the University violated its regulations when it
permitted the Victim to submit her written witness statement or narrative, because
the narrative included a short segment in which the Victim discussed how the
sexual assault impacted her. Because this claim was not preserved below, it should
be reviewed for fundamental error.
Univ. Fla. Reg.                                                                         4.042 provides that any materials relevant to the issue at
hand are to be admitted for the Committee's review. The Victim's written narrative
was included for the Committee's consideration because the Victim's narrative is
relevant to the case, and the Victim's mental state in the wake of the sexual assault
are relevant in determining the Victim's credibility.
Appellant attempts to characterize the Victim's written narrative, submitted
for the Committee's review in the course of the hearing, as an impact statement.
Regulation 4.051(4)(e) provides victims with the right to submit a written impact
statement to the hearing body after the finding of facts if the accused student is
found responsible. The Victim's written narrative was merely a witness statement
and not an impact statement. Appellant contends that any mention of the Victim's
24

suffering after the sexual assault is barred by Reg. 4.051. However, this contention
is incorrect and cannot be reconciled with Reg. 4.042, which permits the admission
of any relevant information or documents. The Victim's written narrative was
appropriately included for the Committee's consideration under 4.042.
B. THE UNIVERSITY CORRECTLY APPLIED ITS REGULATIONS BY
PERMITTING   THE   INCLUSION  OF  RELEVANT   INFORMATION
PERTAINING TO APPELLANT.
Appellant alleges four instances in which the University allowed improper
information to be considered by the Committee. However, Appellant's allegations
are  without basis,  because  Appellant's  argument  relies  solely  on  criminal
evidentiary rules that do not apply to a University disciplinary hearing. The
information alleged to be improperly included is relevant; therefore, properly
included.
Student  Conduct  Committee  hearings  are  governed  by  regulations
promulgated by the University. The procedures applicable to the hearing below are
contained in Regulations                                                               4.042 and   4.051. Regulation   4.042   (7)   (a) permits the
inclusion of information to challenge any witness statement, evidence on the
veracity of any witness whose information is presented at the hearing, and the
asking of questions of any witness through the chair of the hearing body. The right
25

to ask questions of any witness is further extended to the victim. Univ. Fla. Reg.
4.051                                                                                      (4)                                                        (g). The most substantial limitation to what information may be introduced
is that the Victim's unrelated behavior is to be excluded from the hearing.
4.051                                                                                      (4)                                                        (f). Otherwise, admissibility is governed by 4.042(6)(b)-3, which provides
that any materials relevant to the issue at hand are to be admitted, and 4.042(8)
which provides that rules of evidence and procedure that apply in a court
proceeding do not apply here, and that information that supports the factual finding
must be the kind of information upon which reasonable, prudent persons would
rely.
The Victim's testimony regarding Appellant's behavior, and the GPD
officer's  summary  of the  Victim's  statements  are  permissible  under  the
University's regulations, because they are relevant. While University procedures
exclude pure character witnesses from testifying, they do not prevent witnesses
from testifying as to a party's character if that is not the only matter on which they
are testifying. In fact, Appellant's father testified as to Appellant's peaceful nature,
while also testifying about the Victim's character for truthfulness based on her
Asian ethnicity. Appellant's private investigator also testified about Appellant's
character based on interviews of Appellant's ex-girlfriends.
The Victim's allegation in her closing statement about Appellant's ex-
girlfriend Alexandra                                                                       (last name inaudible) was relevant information about the
26

veracity of Appellant's character witnesses, and while it was not supported by any
documentation, it was up to the Committee to decide how much weight and
credibility to place on such information.
Information about Appellant's prior bad conduct is relevant here. Evidence
of prior bad acts is not admissible in criminal courts when such evidence is used
solely to prove bad character or propensity; however, no such rule exists among
the University's regulations.
Finally, Appellant challenges the inclusion of the Victim's petition for a
civil protective order against him. (R.                                              132-36). The Petition is relevant information
to show that the Victim felt threatened by Appellant. Furthermore, the information
contained in the Petition is consistent with the Victim's testimony and the police
reports, which tends to strengthen the credibility of her testimony.
C. APPELLANT WAS  GIVEN PROPER NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE
WITH UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS.
The University's regulations require that a student is given notice of the
charges against him at least seven business days prior to the date of the conduct
hearing. 4042(6)(b)-1(a). Additionally, due process requires adequate notice to be
given; the notice must be "reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to
apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an
27

opportunity to present their objections. The notice must be of such nature as
reasonably to convey the required information, and it must afford a reasonable time
for those interested to make their appearance." Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank
& Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).
Appellant contends that by failing to include the basis for the University's
jurisdiction, he was denied his due process right to notice. 4.041(2) provides:
(2) Scope. Disciplinary action may be imposed for violations of the
Student Honor Code or Student Conduct Code occurring at any of the
following locations or activities:
(d) Other off-campus conduct as set forth in this paragraph (d):
•                                                                                      •           •
2. The University may take conduct action against a student for off-campus
conduct if it is required by law to do so, if the conduct arises from
University activities, or if the conduct poses a significant threat to the safety
or security of the University community, or if the conduct poses a significant
threat of undermining the University's educational process.                            (emphasis
added).
University of Florida Regulation 4.041(2).   It is evident that 4.041(2)(d) does not
create a charge against Appellant, because it would be impossible to charge him
with violating solely this provision.                                                  4.041       (2)   (d) merely sets the scope of the
University's jurisdiction for charging a student for off-campus conduct. Neither the
University regulations nor due process require notice of jurisdiction. While
Appellant has a due process right to have his hearing conducted by a Committee
28

with subject matter jurisdiction, Appellant does not challenge the jurisdiction of
the University in this appeal. Rather, he argues that he was not given adequate
notice. However, Appellant was given notice of the charges brought against him in
a timely manner, and the University is not required to give him notice of proper
jurisdiction.
D. APPELLANT WAS PROVIDED WITH A FAIR HEARING THAT
COMPLIED WITH HIS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS.
Appellant alleges that certain members of the Dean of Students Office and
the Student Conduct Committee were biased against him. The charges against
Appellant were  heard before  a  seven-person  Committee,  while  Asst.  Dean
Loschiavo acted as the administrative liaison to the Committee. In accordance with
Univ. Fla. Reg.                                                                        4.0431   (3), the Committee provided its findings to the Dean of
Students, Jen Day Shaw, who simply reviewed the Committee's decision and
decided in conformity therewith. Thus, Asst. Dean Loschiavo regulated the
procedural aspects of the hearing, while the Committee itself acted as the finder of
fact, and Dean Shaw acted as the final decision maker.
Due process requires that an administrative proceeding be "essentially
fair." Student Alpha Id No. Guja v. Sch. Bd. of Volusia County, 616 So. 2d 1011,
1013 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993), citing Gordon v. Savage, 383 So.2d 646 (Fla. 5th DCA
29

1980). "The extent of procedural due process afforded to a party in a quasi-judicial
hearing is not as great as that afforded to a party in a full judicial hearing", and,
likewise the impartiality of the trial is subject to less scrutiny than a full judicial
hearing. Carillon Cmty. Residential v. Seminole County, 45 So.3d 7,                       10          (Fla.     5th
DCA 2010), reh'g denied (Oct. 6, 2010), review denied, 60 So. 3d 386 (Fla. 2011),
citing Seminole Entertainment, Inc. v. City of Casselberry,                               811 So.2d   693,      696
(Fla. 5th DCA 2001).
I.                                                                                        STUDENT     CONDUCT   COMMITTEE   MEMBERS   ACTED
APPROPRIATELY AS FINDERS OF FACT IN APPELLANT'S HEARING.
Appellant alleges that two members of the Student Conduct Committee, Mr.
Ascher and Ms. Myers, were biased against Appellant and denied him a fair
hearing because they asked him certain questions and made certain statements
during the hearing. However, Appellant's allegation is without basis because it is
proper for Committee members to ask questions in order to reach a conclusion and
make statements or comments indicating an impression or opinion as to the facts of
the case, during the hearing.
The  finder of fact "is  not required to  abstain from  forming mental
impressions and opinions during the course of the presentation of evidence". Mobil
v. Trask,                                                                                 463 So.     2d 389,   391         (Fla.     1st DCA   1985), citing City of Palatka v.
30

Frederick,                                                                            128 Fla. 366,    174 So. 826 (1937). Moreover, "disqualifying a [finder of
fact] because his examination of a witness on relevant matters gives a clue as to
how he may be inclined to rule at the end of the evidence would wreak
administrative havoc. . ." Nateman v. Greenbaum,                                      582 So.2d 643,   644 (Fla.                                                   3d
DCA 1991).
At the time Ms. Myers questioned Appellant's statement that the hole in
bottom of the bathroom door was "very small", the Committee had seen numerous
pictures of the door, and heard testimony regarding the door from the Victim and
two GPD detectives. (R. 323). Ms. Meyers was entitled to form an opinion as to
what constitutes a very small hole. Furthermore, Ms. Meyers' statement "that sure
sounds angry," in response to Appellant admitting he kicked the door, is "the
variety of statement or question. . . posed . . . in order to stimulate a response
which would better enable the judge or deputy to adjudicate the compensability of
the claim."   Mobil,                                                                  436 So.2d        389,                                                        391. Similarly, Ms. Myers' question to
Appellant about whether he is an expert on victim behavior is appropriate, and
serves to clarify how much weight his opinion on victim behavior should be given.
(R. 370).
When Mr. Thompson, the private investigator hired by Appellant, testified
as to the hole in the bathroom door and stated that it was on the bedroom door, Mr.
Asher and the rest of the Committee had already heard Appellant's admission that
31

he kicked a hole in the bathroom door. (R. 377). Therefore, their correction of Mr.
Thompson was appropriate.  Similarly, Appellant's allegation that Mr. Ascher was
demonstrating bias when he stated that "on the same morning when [Victim] went
to take a shower, she locked the bathroom door — we've already established that
this happened" is incorrect. (R. 352). In fact, mere minutes prior to that, Appellant
testified that the Victim had gone into the bathroom to take a shower and had
locked the bathroom door. (R. 324).
The  Committee's  statements  and  questions  during  the  hearing  were
completely reasonable and proper as an exercise of their role as the finder of fact.
II. ASSISTANT DEAN LOSCHIAVO AND DEAN SHAW WERE NOT
REQUIRED TO RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM PARTICIPATING IN
APPELLANT'S PROCEEDINGS.
Appellant requests recusal or disqualification on the basis of bias during the
proceedings below; however, Appellant is barred from bringing this claim as part
of this appeal. Since the University is not subject to the APA, Appellant's only
recourse is to raise his allegations of bias as a constitutional issue. Florida Water
Services Corp.,                                                                         856 So.2d   1035,   1041   (Fla.   5th DCA 2003).   Thus, Appellant
cannot request that this Court review the allegations of bias by Asst. Dean
32

Loschiavo and Dean Shaw without showing a material violation of his right to a
fair hearing, which Appellant has failed to establish.
III.                                                                             THE   CORRESPONDENCE   BETWEEN   ASSISTANT   DEAN
LOSCHIAVO  AND  DEAN  SHAW  DOES  NOT  ESTABLISH  BIAS
AGAINST APPELLANT.
Appellant alleges that two e-mail exchanges between Asst. Dean Loschiavo
and Dean Shaw establish that they were biased against Appellant. The first
exchange, with the final response by Asst. Dean Loschiavo included (which was
omitted by Appellant in his brief) states:
LOSCHIAVO: This is what we are dealing with on this case. They are
getting on my last nerve which isn't smart given I am hearing the case.
SHAW: I'm sorry — I know they're trying. I just had a long conversation
with our General Counsel regarding the student with Larry last week. Help
any knowing you aren't the only one? :)
LOSCHIAVO: Just needed to vent because I know they already have written
to Dave once. We literally just sent the hearing schedule notice out minutes
before that. To GPD and the alleged victim we look like we don't know
what we are doing. We just sent them more dates and give him some
choices, he can miss class and a couple of Monday's are available or he will
need to wait until after Thanksgiving the way his schedule, her schedule and
my schedule line up.
SHAW: Since this charge is so serious, probably better to have dad and
attorney available although they both don't get to come anyway, do they?
LOSCHIAVO: They are serving as witnesses not advisors, apparently they
have had some direct interactions with [Victim]. I remain a bit skeptical of
33

this however but that is what Chase is telling me. I am trying to out fair him.
We'll see how that works out.
(R. 66-70). The plain language of this exchange does not show any intent to punish
Appellant for requesting continuances. Asst. Dean Loschiavo's statement that it is
not smart to get on his last nerve does not show intent to penalize, but rather that
he is frustrated about coordinating the presence of various people including the
police officers involved in a way that works for everyone. Further, stating that he
intends to out-fair Appellant due to the seriousness of the charges shows that, if
anything, Asst. Dean Loschiavo is trying harder than he is required to ensure
Appellant gets as fair and proper a hearing as possible. It is inappropriate to infer
that by stating he wants to be extra fair, Asst. Dean Loschiavo was really
attempting to be extra unfair. Such a reading is an unreasonable stretch.
The second e-mail exchange wherein Appellant alleges bias is an e-mail
between Asst. Dean Loschiavo and Dean Shaw after Appellant's hearing and
official sanctions.                                                                     (R.   182-184). Dean Shaw tells Asst. Dean Loschiavo that she
"[w]ent and listened to some of [Appellant's] closing statement. "I've never been a
violent person." Hello — voice mail?!", to which Asst. Dean Loschiavo responds
that it "[m]ade [him] laugh."                                                           (R.   182).
Because this exchange takes place after the entire process was concluded,
Asst. Dean Loschiavo and Dean Shaw were no longer acting in their capacity as
34

quasi-judicial officers. There is no bar to discussing their impressions of the case
with each other, and furthermore, their statements in the e-mail are consistent with
their findings in the case.
IV. ASSISTANT DEAN LOSCHIAVO ENSURED  THAT APPELLANT
RECEIVED                                                                               A     FAIR                                                                        HEARING   BY   ADMINISTERING   THE
UNIVERSITY'S  REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES  IMPARTIALLY
AND FAIRLY.
Asst.  Dean Loschiavo,  in  his  role  as the  administrative  liaison  and
procedural officer at the hearing, followed University regulations correctly and
ensured that Appellant received a fair hearing. As discussed supra, the University's
regulations and procedures are more permissive than rules of evidence employed
by courts. After a threshold determination of relevance by Asst. Dean Loschiavo,
most information is admitted, so long as it is relevant, not information about the
Victim's  unrelated  behavior,  and  is  submitted  in  a  timely  fashion.  Reg.
4.042                                                                                  (6)   (b)-2.  Asst.  Dean  Loschiavo's  final  decisions  on  admissibility  of
information should be reviewed by this Court under the abuse of discretion
standard. Davis v. State, 859 So.2d 465 (Fla.2003)
Appellant's first allegation of improper discretion is that he was not allowed
to introduce a note given to him by the Victim. (R. 370). However, Appellant was
35

permitted to introduce a photograph he submitted of the note, but he failed to
ensure that the photograph of the note he sent was the proper file size and format;
therefore, the text of the note was not legible. (R. 369-370). Since the University
regulations require that all evidence is submitted at least seven days prior to the
hearing, Asst. Dean Loschiavo denied Appellant's request to admit a different copy
of the note during the hearing.                                                        4.042                         (6)                (b)-2. Appellant cannot on one hand
carelessly submit illegible information and on the other hand blame the University
for following its regulations.
The second abuse of discretion Appellant alleges concerns Asst. Dean
Loschiavo's modification of some of his questions for the Victim. Of the               67
questions Appellant submitted,                                                         49 were asked as requested,   8 were not asked
because the Victim had already answered them in her opening statement (questions
1-7, 9), 6 were not asked because they were irrelevant (question 8, 51, 60-63), one
question was reworded in an immaterial way (question 46), and 3 were combined
into one question preserving the essence of the originals                              (questions                    64-66).            (R.
244-266).
Appellant alleges that the rewording of question 46 was improper, and that
Asst. Dean Loschiavo should have specifically asked whether the Victim left
pictures of herself on Appellant's computer for Appellant to locate. (R. 169). Asst.
Dean Loschiavo asked the question without asking whether she left them for
36

Appellant to locate. The omitted part of the question has no material value or
relevance, even if Appellant is right that it would show that she still had some
remaining affection for him. It only serves to bring in evidence of the Victim's
other unrelated behavior, which is prohibited by the University's regulations.
Asst. Dean Loschiavo also appropriately refused to ask Appellant's                      51st
question, which was to ask. Victim whether she was aware of the polygraph test
Appellant undertook. Victim is not an expert on polygraph examinations, and her
knowledge of whether Appellant took a polygraph exam is entirely irrelevant.
Appellant was in fact allowed to introduce evidence of his polygraph and ask
questions of Det. Fair and Cpl. Armstrong as well as Mr. Thompson in regards to
his polygraph test.
Asst. Dean Loschiavo further reworded Appellant's question about Victim's
interactions with his former, attorney, Mr. Silverman. (R. 171). Appellant's original
questions were leading, accusatory and confrontational. Asst. Dean Loschiavo
asked the same questions without the confrontational tone. The Victim answered
lengthily, and addressed the allegation that she had falsely accused Mr. Silverman
of bribery.                                                                             (R.    265-66). Her response addressed all three of Appellant's initial
questions.
37

Finally, Appellant alleges that his questions 60-67 were not asked. However,
as mentioned above, 64-66 were merged into the question regarding Mr. Silverman
and  whether he  attempted  to  bribe the  Victim.  Question                          67  is  irrelevant
information about the victim's other unrelated behavior, and properly excluded.
60-63 were not asked because they were irrelevant; they did not tend to prove any
relevant fact to Appellant's case, nor did they challenge the Victim's credibility.
Asst. Dean Loschiavo performed his task of balancing Appellant's right to a fair
hearing with the Victim's rights correctly, and ensured that Appellant received a
fair hearing. Asst. Dean Loschiavo allowed all relevant information presented by
both parties. Furthermore, Appellant received answers to 61 of his 67 questions for
the Victim, and Asst. Dean Loschiavo only refrained from asking six questions that
were irrelevant to the proceedings.
CONCLUSION
Appellant does not raise any basis for the reversal of the University's
decision. The University's decision is based on competent substantial evidence, the
University applied the law correctly, and Appellant was afforded full due process
in the proceedings below. All of Appellant's allegations are without merit, and the
Court should affirm the University's decision.

IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL
FIRST DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA
CHASE CORBIN,
Appellant,                                                                                           Cases No. 1D12-1088
v.
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
APPELLANT'S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
OF FORTY-FIVE (45) DAYS IN WHICH TO FILE REPLY BRIEF
COMES NOW the Appellant, CORBIN CHASE, by and through undersigned counsel, to
request an extension of time of 45 days in which to file his reply brief. As grounds therefore the
following is stated:
1.                                                                                                   Mr. Corbin is appealing the final order of his suspension from the University of
Florida following the University's finding that he violated several provisions of the Conduct
Code. Mr. Corbin's initial brief is due today, February 1, 2013.
2.                                                                                                   Undersigned counsel has begun drafting Mr. Corbin's reply brief and anticipated
finishing it this week, but she is representing Paul Augustus Howell, a Florida inmate for whom
an execution date of February 26, 2013, has been set. Given that Mr. Howell is under death
warrant, counsel has been working around the clock to file motions on his behalf  While she
anticipates being able to file Mr. Corbin's motion long before                                       45 days, in an abundance of
caution, she is requesting until well after the execution with the assumption that numerous
pressing matters in her practice will have to be delayed in the interim.
3.                                                                                                   Undersigned counsel has contacted Counsel for the University, Brande Smith,
1

who has indicated by email that she has no objection to this motion and does not intend to file a
response.
WHEREFORE, Mr. Corbin moves that this motion for a 45-day extension of time for
filing his reply brief be granted.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been e-mailed to Amy Hass, Office of the
General Counsel, University of Florida,                                                             123 Tigert Hall, P.O. Box   113125, Gainesville, FL
32611-3157, at amhass@ufl.edu, on this the 1st day of February, 2013. It is my intent that this
filing be accepted by the court pursuant to my agreement that submitting this document for filing
creates the same obligations as my original signature would create on a paper document.

IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA
FIRST DISTRICT
CHASE CORBIN,
Appellant,
v.                                                                                                   Case Number: 1D12-1088
STATE OF FLORIDA,
Appellee.
REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT
COMES NOW the Appellant, CHASE CORBIN, by and through undersigned counsel,
and moves this Honorable Court to grant oral argument in the above-styled matter pursuant to
Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.320.
Mr. Corbin has raised three meritorious claims on appeal with several grounds for each
claim. The analysis is highly fact intensive and many facts have been omitted from his brief due
to space limitations.  Further, university conduct violations are not often appealed to the courts
and the law is therefore sparse.  Finally, this Court has recently rejected jurisdiction over such
appeals in a case issued after Mr. Corbin filed his Notice of Appeal. See Decker v. Univ. of W.
Fla.,                                                                                                85 So.                   3d 571   (Fla.       1st DCA 2012). He has addressed this jurisdictional issue in his brief
and believes the Court would benefit from oral argument.
WHEREFORE, Appellant respectfully requests that the Court grant his request for said
argument.
I CERTIFY that a copy of this motion has been emailed to Amy Haas, Office of the
General Counsel, University of Florida, at amhass@UFLEDU on this the 4th day of March,

2013. It is my intent that this filing be accepted by the court pursuant to my agreement that
submitting this document for filing creates the same obligations as my original signature would
create on a paper document.
