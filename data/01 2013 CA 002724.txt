Upon consideration of appellant's response to the Court's order of May 1, 2013, the Court
has determined that review of the order on appeal is properly sought by petition for writ of certiorari in the circuit court. Fla. R. App. P. 9.160(b)(3); see Decker v. University of West Florida, 85 So. 3d 571 (Fla. 1st DCA 2012). Accordingly, and pursuant to Florida Rule of â€¢ Appellate Procedure 9.040(b)(1), the cause is hereby transferred to the Eighth Circuit Court in and for Alachua County. Appellee's motion to dismiss, filed on April 30, 2013, is denied. Petitioner Pro Se, Felicia A. Wider-Lewis replies to the court's order to
show cause regarding jurisdiction as follows: At the time petitioner filed the notice
of appeal, she was unaware of this court's president announced in Decker. See
Decker v. University of West Florida, 85 So.3d 571,573 (Fla. 15` DCA 2012).  She
remained unaware of it until the court reiterated this position in Corbin on April 4th
of this year.  See Corbin v. Univ. of Florida, 38 Fla. L. Weekly D759 (Fla. 1st
DCA Apr. 4, 2013). Petitioner incorporated both decisions into her reply brief and
acknowledged that in cases such as the petitioner's the First District Court of
Appeals will treat the notice of appeal and initial brief as a writ of certiorari and
transfers the case to the court of appropriate jurisdiction. As each party acknowledged in their respective pleadings, jurisdiction over this matter lies with the Eight Circuit court in Alachua County. However, contrary to the University of Florida's position in its motion to dismiss, a naked dismissal of this appeal is not the appropriate action. Each of the three cases cited in the University's motion to dismiss treated the initial pleading of the appellant as a petition for writ of certiorari and transfers the case to the appropriate court. There is no cause why this Honorable Court should not transfer the matter to the court with jurisdiction and direct the initial
pleadings of the petitioner be treated as a Petition for Writ of Certiorari.
Wherefore, petitioner prays this Honorable Court consider the Notice of
Appeal and Initial Brief as a Petition for Writ of Certiorari and transfer this matter
to the Eight Circuit in Alachua County. Appellant, Felicia Wider-Lewis, timely appeals the findings and recommendations of the University of Florida Student Conduct Committee
(`SCC') , as well as the decision and order of Dean of Student Affairs, Jen Day
Shaw, (`Dean') upholding those findings, imposing sanctions, and suspending the
appellant for violation of the university's student honor code's prohibition of
"Unauthorized Use of Materials or Resources" proscribed in 6C1-4.041(3)(b)(3),
by allegedly "cheating" on her August 27th 2012 Doctoral Qualifying Examination
in Special Education. The facts that give rise to this case and appeal are as follows: Appellant was a doctoral student in the Special Education Doctoral Program of the University of Florida. Ms. Wider-Lewis was recommended by her professors to sit for the
Qualifying Examination. On the examination date, Ms. Wider-Lewis arrived on-
time at the faculty office, which was the location designated by her committee for
her to take the exam. She waited in the reception with a faculty employee named
Vicky Tucker until the designated proctor arrived and escorted her to the faculty
computer terminal on which she took her qualifying exam. Faculty secretary,
Shira Rivas-Otero, who proctored the exam, testified she observed appellant take
the exam on August 27th by checking-in on her several times throughout the exam
period and she observed no irregularities in appellant's test taking. On September 5th, the chair of her committee emailed the appellant requesting she attend a
meeting to be held on September 7th. At that meeting, which was held in the office
of the department chair rather than committee chair's office as originally noticed,
each chairperson and a professor who appeared by telephone interrogated the
appellant about her response to question two and her preparation for the exam.
Appellant responded intelligently and knowledgeably to all of the faculty's
questions and offered her notes, research, references, and all means of preparation,
for their inspection. On September 12th 2012, appellant's committee chair sent
appellant an email which scheduled a retake of day one of the exam in thirteen
days on September 25th 2012. Due to family and other obligations, as well as
emotional disenchantment with her program, Mrs. Wider-Lewis did not prepare in
the same fashion for the retake exam. After she completed the retake, appellant's committee chair advised that the oral portion of the exam had been cancelled and asked appellant to appear at another meeting. When appellant inquired whether she could or should bring counsel to the proposed meeting with her, the department chair then sent appellant an email cancelling the proposed meeting and formally charging the appellant with a violation of academic dishonesty.
Prior to the original August 27th exam, Professor Gagnon had twice emailed
appellant a verbatim copy of the exact question that later appeared as Question Two. Professor Gagnon sent appellant an email calling her into his office for a
meeting nearly three weeks prior to the exam. At that meeting, Professor Gagnon
reviewed a draft response appellant wrote for the question he had emailed her. He
also provided specific guidance on ways appellant should improve her response,
specific resources to be referenced, and directions concerning finding additional
references.  The appellant prepared for this exam question by drafting, revising,
and repetitively writing-out her practice response to it on a daily basis. The
appellant was never told and had no way of knowing that the same question she
used for preparation would appear verbatim, unchanged on the exam itself. At the
hearing, Professor Gagnon stated that he likes to give the exact question because
"it takes away the anxiety and the stress." Appellant testified that she attended a
fellowship meeting in which the committee chair advised the entire group that
students will have the "exam topics" well in advanced, but not the exact question.
At the hearing, the same committee chair testified "it is up to the individual
professors to decide whether to give the exact question or not."
The SCC held its hearing beginning on November 15th 2012 at 9AM. In the
early afternoon, Professor Gagnon requested the SCC hearing be continued, stating
that he had a doctor's appointment scheduled for 2PM.  The hearing was then
stopped until the SCC reconvened on November 29th. On the first day of the
hearing, SCC members asked appellant what specific materials she used to study and prepare for the exam question. Mrs. Wider-Lewis sought to direct the SCC
member's attention to the articles she cited in the exam response which she had
submitted for inclusion in her hearing binder, but Amanda Hambleton who was the
Assistant Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution committee had
elected to exclude these items. Ms. Hambleton provided no rationale, written or
otherwise, for excluding these or any other items, and provided no notice that she
had in fact excluded them. Appellant requested to arrange for a stenographer to be
present at her expense to record the proceedings. The university advised that the
rules do not permit this. However, the university made its own audio recording of
the proceedings, and refused to provide a copy thereof to appellant. Appellant was
immediately sanctioned with an expulsion that forbade her from setting foot on the
University of Florida campus under threat of criminal trespass. Due to the official
sanction, appellant is prohibited from going in to the UF Student Conduct and
Conflict Resolution (`SCCR') office to inspect the record as authorized under the
UF regulations. Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, Jeanna Mastrodicasa, mitigated
the original sanction from expulsion to suspension, as a result of appellant's appeal
to the Dean of Student affairs. However, the university has provided no notice of
lifting the criminal trespass threat. The appeal to the Dean of Student Affairs
resulted in the Dean upholding the prior decisions regarding responsibility. The University of Florida conducted disciplinary proceedings against the
appellant that lacked adequate substantive and procedural safeguards of fairness
for the appellant, resulting in an unjust decision that was not based on competent
substantial evidence. The findings and recommendations of the SCC, as well as
the final decision of Dean Shaw, departed from the essential requirements of law.
The University's case against appellant was based solely upon circumstantial
evidence that does not preponderate over appellant's reasonable explanation of her
superior performance on Question 2 of Day One Exam. Appellant reasonably
explains her superior performance on the exam question in question with the facts
that her professor furnished her (1) the exact question verbatim as appeared on the
exam, and (2) detailed guidance as to how to produce a response to his satisfaction,
(3) including specific sources to be cited; (4) where no such question, guidance, or
sources were provided for any of the other exam questions. Given her super-
adequate preparation exclusively for that exact question, appellant's superior
performance on it was to be reasonably expected. The SCC's findings relied heavily on testimony and evidence that would not be admissible if offered as evidence in a trial under the Florida Rules of Evidence. Further, the evidence the SCC relied upon was not "information upon which reasonable, prudent persons would rely in the conduct of their affairs" sufficient to meet the standard contained in the Regulation of the University of Florida. The SCC afforded undue deference to improper, irrelevant generalized statements given by professors as testimony which had probative value that was substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice and confusion of issues those statements created. This undue deference to improper testimony from the professors amounted to granting the
professors unlimited discretion concerning alleged violations of the Student Honor
Code, resulting arbitrary and capricious recommendations and decisions against
the appellant causing her great harm and damages. This is akin to the situation
described in Chief Judge Casanueva's concurrence in LaRose and the University of
Tampa v. A.K. "An overbroad reading of the University's definition of plagiarism,
coupled with the University's position that intent to plagiarize is not required to
constitute a violation of the academic code, arguably results in almost unlimited
discretion afforded to faculty to determine whether a student plagiarized a paper."
LaRose v. A.K., 37 So. 2d 265 (Fla. 2d DCA 2009).                                     (The court upheld student
A.K.'s injunction because she would likely suffer irreparable harm from an adverse
decision of the University's and she had a meritorious defense.)
The SCC utterly failed to weigh or even consider any of the copious
exculpatory evidence appellant presented. This exculpatory evidence included: (1)
testimony of university officials who monitored the two examinations who each stated that all university and department procedures were followed during the
testing and that they each observed no irregularities, (2) faculty's own
investigation of its own computer used for the August 27th 2012 exam revealed no
evidence of any downloads or tampering, (3) appellant voluntarily submitted her
cellular phone records which revealed no calls or data transmissions were made or
received during the examination time, and (4) no source for the writings other than
appellant herself was ever identified.
The SCC's internally inconsistent written rationale applied a vague,
meaningless, and unfair standard to improperly conclude appellant violated the
Student Honor Code. Even assuming the truth of all the "facts" cited by the SCC's
rationale; the conduct described does not establish a violation of the letter the
provision of the Student Honor Code which appellant was charged with violating.
The SCC only reached its conclusions by way of an evidentiary presumption that is
not authorized by any statue, regulation of the University of Florida, or by any
court of law, finding that "clear differences" among writing samples is conclusive
proof of use of unauthorized material or resources. This irrebuttable presumption
unlawfully shifted the burden to appellant to prove the negative that she did not use
unauthorized material or resources on the August 27th exam.
Beyond the SCC's departures from the essential requirements of law
protecting appellant's substantive rights described above, the University violated appellant's procedural due process rights. A OF Student Conduct and Conflict
Resolution (`SCCR') official abused her discretion by arbitrarily removing relevant
exculpatory evidence from appellant's hearing evidence binder. The university
further violated the appellant's procedural due process rights by permitting her
accusers to participate in the deliberations concerning both responsibility and
recommendation, outside of appellant's presence. The university denied appellant
her procedural right to make a record of the proceedings and denied appellant
access to the record the university made of those proceedings. In sum, by
employing an unauthorized evidentiary presumptions based on incompetent,
irrelevant circumstantial evidence, by ignoring the greater weight of the evidence
which manifestly favored the appellant, and by erecting unfair insurmountable
procedural obstacles in appellant's path, the university created a .completely
uneven playing field for appellant to defend herself against the charge of her
accuser and a machine for rubberstamping allegations founded only upon a
professor's mere suspicion. 
THE SCC FINDINGS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY COMPETENT SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
The Student Conduct Committee (`SCC') relied on testimony and other
evidence which could not be admitted under the Florida Rules of Evidence. The
evidence the SCC relied upon fails even to meet the far lesser standard of evidence
delineated in the Regulations of the University of Florida. Aside from the
unreliable and incompetent evidence from which SCC drew improper inferences
and conclusions, there was no competent substantial evidence upon which the SCC
could reach its conclusion that appellant used unauthorized material and/or
assistance in completing the Day 1 Qualifying Exam for Special Education
Doctoral Program.
Section 120.68(7)(b) of the Florida Statutes (2012) states, in relevant part:
"The court shall remand a case to the agency for further proceedings
consistent with the court's decision or set aside agency action, as
appropriate, when it finds that:
(b)   The agency's action depends on any finding of fact that is not
supported by competent, substantial evidence in the record of a
hearing conducted pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57; however, the
court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the
weight of the evidence on any disputed finding of fact..." Over the objections of appellant, four professors were permitted to provide irrelevant, bolstering testimony as to their past experience with students other than the appellant in years past. This testimony held no probative value regarding whether appellant used unauthorized material on the August 27th exam. See Â§90.401 Fla. Stat. (2012). This testimony, however, was highly and unfairly prejudicial to the appellant's defense, confused the issues, and misled the SCC members. See Â§90.403 Fla. Stat. (2012). The written rationale of the SCC
Hearing Recommendations reflect this confusion and prejudice in the penultimate
statement "The testimony of the professors that the style of writing used on initial
Question 2 was 'unlike' anything they saw previously from the student and was
`unlike' other peer submissions in all their collective years of experience."
Regarding "other peer submissions," this rationale is a vague comparison showing
no qualitative distinctions between any specific aspects of any two writing samples
compared to one another under any reasonable articulated standard. The testimony
this rationale is based upon is not proper opinion or reputation evidence, but is
instead irrelevant, broad generalizations. Even if true, the fact that appellant's
response was "unlike" other peer submission from doctoral students who took the
exam in years past has no tendency in logic to prove or disprove any material fact
of the allegation that appellant used unauthorized materials to produce her response
to question 2 of day one's exam. This alleged dissimilarity with all pervious "peer submissions" served only to create unfair prejudice and to induce the trier of fact to
wrongly conclude that some vague dissimilarity amongst responses or the
uniqueness of a response in itself is evidence of "cheating" ,on an exam.  This error
was clearly not harmless because it patently influenced the SCC's conclusion,
appeared prominently in the SCC's written rationale, and is at the core of the
decision. The final statement of the written rationale further reveals the extreme
deference and bias fostered in the SCC members by the improper bolstering
testimony of the professors. It reads "The number of citation on both question 2
submissions was far + above any other submissions of students who far
exceeded the writing style of the student." This is yet another vague and unfair
comparison to unidentified works of students in the past according to unspecified
criteria. The improper testimony of Professor Gagnon at the hearing was "No
student could possibly produce 41 citations." However, Prof. Gagnon had to later
admit in the hearing that he, along with the other professors that observed her,
personally witnessed the appellant produced the exact same number of citations on
the second take of the exam question. The SCC contorted and distorted this fact
which is in fact in appellant's favor to illogically mean that producing the same
number of citations on the second taking is somehow indicative of cheating
because it is still a number of citations that is "far + above any other submissions of students who far exceeded the writing style of the student." Any generalized
reference to "other submissions" of other students should have been stricken
because such evidence does not constitute competent evidence.
The remaining so called "findings of fact" made by the SCC are immaterial
and irrelevant to proving an unauthorized use of materials or resources in violation
of "Student Honor Code. The SCC held Mrs. Wider-Lewis responsible for
violation of "Student Honor Code/3(b)/3b3," [sic] which reads as follows:
