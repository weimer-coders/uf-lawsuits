State of Florida, and as such was entitled to limited sovereign immunity from suit pursuant to the
11th Amendment to the United States Constitution, Section 13, Article X of the Florida Constitution,
and Fla. Stat. § 766.28.
14.                                                                                                       At all times material hereto Defendant SHANDS was a duly licensed independent
private hospital located in Alachua County, Florida.
15.                                                                                                       At all times material hereto PAREKATTIL was a licensed Florida medical doctor,
Florida Board Certified in Urology, under the supervision and control of SHANDS. Alternatively or
concurrently, PARKETTIL was employee of Defendant UFBOT as an assistant professor of urology
at the University of Florida College of Medicine.
16.                                                                                                       Plaintiff CIHLAR first encountered PAREKATTIL in an online chat room dedicated
to urological disorders.
17.                                                                                                       At the time CIHLAR was suffering from chronic right testicular pain that had not
                                                                                                          resolved with conservative treatment. CIHLAR had been searching the interne for support or
                                                                                                          suggestions for resolving his symptoms when he was solicited by PAREKATTIL.
18.                                                                                                       CIHLAR and PAREKATTIL exchanged a few e-mails and one telephone call,

following which PAREKATTIL invited CIHLAR to SHANDS UF to undergo an unconventional
procedure known as a robotic assisted microneurolysis of the spermatic cord.
19.                                                                                                        CIHLAR presented to PAREKATTIL at SHANDS UF for an initial evaluation
Sunday, November 22,                                                                                       2009, and Parekattil performed a robotic assisted microneurolysis of
CIHLAR'S spennatic cord the following day, Monday, November 23, 2009 at SHANDS UF.
20.                                                                                                        The November 23, 2009 procedure did not relieve or diminish CIHLAR'S chronic
right testicular pain. Instead the procedure was performed incorrectly resulting in increased testicular
pain and permanent damage to CIHLAR'S ilioinquinal and iliohypogastric nerves manifested by
severe right flank pain.
21.                                                                                                        Following the November 23, 2009 procedure PAREKATTIL and CIHLAR exchanged
more emails and telephone calls, and as result of CIHLAR'S continuing complaints of pain
PAREKATTIL invited CIHLAR back to UF SHANDS for a robotic assisted abdominal neurolysis of
the spermatic cord and a radical right orchiectemy.
22.                                                                                                        Again the course of treatment was pre-determined by PAREKATTIL without a prior
physical evaluation of CIHLAR.
23.                                                                                                        CIHLAR presented to PAREKATTIL at SHANDS UF for the second round of
procedures March 1, 2010.
24.                                                                                                        The March 1, 2010 procedures did not or diminish CIHLAR'S prior symptoms of
right testicular pain and right flank pain. Instead, CIHLAR'S preexisting symptoms persisted, they
were complimented by new symptoms secondary to the March 1, 2010 procedure, including an
involuntary movement disorder, severe abdominal pain, painful erections, radicular pain, no
sensation of bladder filling, incontinence, sweating and vomiting.
25.                                                                                                        All of CIHLAR'S symptoms as more particularly described above are continuing and

permanent within a reasonable degree of medical probability.
26.                                                                                                    As a result of the three surgical procedures perfoll ied by PAREKATTIL, CIHLAR
has suffered a catastrophic injury as defined by Fla. Stat. § 766.118.
COUNT I- NEGLIGENCE (PAREKATTIL)
27.                                                                                                    CIHLAR adopts and realleges all of the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 26 of this
Complaint as if fully stated herein.
28.                                                                                                    This is an action for medical negligence resulting in damages in excess of $15,000.00.
29.                                                                                                    As an employee of UFBOT, PAREKATTIL is entitled to sovereign immunity from
suits arising from negligent acts and omissions committed in the course and scope of his
employment.
30.                                                                                                    Despite PAREKATTIL'S status, generally, as an immune employee of UFBOT, the
procedures performed on CIHLAR were performed by PAREKATTIL under the supervision and
control of SI1ANDS, rather than as an employee of UFBOT. As a result PAREKATTIL is not
immune from suit.
31.                                                                                                    PAREKKATIL had a duty provide CIHLAR with medical care and treatment in
accordance with the prevailing standard of professional care that is recognized and as acceptable by
reasonably prudent health care providers in the same or similar community.
32.                                                                                                    With respect to the November 23, 2009 procedure PAREKATTIL breached the
prevailing professional standard of care by:
a.                                                                                                     Failing to take the necessary and proper precautions to protect and preserve
CIHLAR'S ilioinquinal and iliohypogastric nerves during the procedure, and as a direct and
proximate result of that failure, by causing permanent damage to said nerves with a surgical
instrument.

b.                                                                                                By failing to perform or order appropriate diagnostic testing prior to the
procedure that would have eliminated the spermatic cord as a source of pain, and would have
contraindicated the procedure altogether.
c.                                                                                                Otherwise failing to properly diagnose the source of CIHLAR'S complaints of
pain.
d.                                                                                                Failing to disclose more conservative courses of treatment such as local nerve
blocks, or the risk of nerve pain spread, nervous system overload, central nerve sensitization,
and windup that could all result in long term disability.
33.                                                                                               With respect to the March 1, 2010 procedure PAREKATTIL, breached the prevailing
professional standard of care by:
a.                                                                                                Failing to recognize the symptoms CIHLAR developed following the
November 23, 2009 procedure were the result of damage PAREKATTIL, had inflicted on
CIHLAR during the November 29,                                                                    2009 procedure. Such a realization would have
contraindicated the second procedure altogether.
b.                                                                                                Failing to perform or order appropriate diagnostic testing prior to the
procedure that would have eliminated the spermatic cord as a source of pain, and would have
contraindicated the procedure altogether.
c.                                                                                                Otherwise failing to properly diagnose the source of CIHLAR'S complaints of
pain.
d.                                                                                                Recommending a radical right orchiectomy because there was no evidence of
testicle process causing CIHLAR'S pain.
e.                                                                                                Failing to disclose more conservative courses of treatment such as local nerve
blocks.

f.                                                                                                    Failing to disclose pertinent risks of the procedure that could all result in long
term disability, such as nerve pain spread, nervous system overload, central nerve
sensitization, and windup.
g.                                                                                                    Mispresenting the probability a robotic assisted abdominal neurolysis of the
spermatic cord would relieve CIHLAR'S pain.
h.                                                                                                    Mispresenting the probability a robotic assisted abdominal neurolysis of the
spermatic cord performed in conjunction with a radical right orchiectomy would relieve
CIHLAR'S pain.
34.                                                                                                   As a direct and proximate result of foreoing deviations and departures from the
standard of care, CIHLAR, has suffered permanent neurological damage, urological dysfunction,
disfigurement, the loss of a testicle, and other injuries yet to be determined.

above, CIHLAR suffered bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering, disability or physical
impairment, disfigurement, mental anguish, inconvenience, lost earnings, loss of ability to earn
income in the future, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, expense of hospitalization, and
expense of medical and nursing care and treatment. The losses are either permanent or continuing in
nature and CIHLAR will suffer these losses in the future.
36.                                                                                                   As a direct and proximate result of the negligence of PAREKATTIL, as alleged
above, CIHLAR suffered a catastrophic injury as defined by Fla. Stat. § 766.118.
WHEREFORE Plaintiff BRETT CIHLAR demands Judgment for damages against
Defendant SIJO PAREKATTIL, M.D. for compensatory damages, costs interest, and other such
relief as this Court deems just. CIHLAR further demands trial by jury.

PAREKKATIL made the following material misrepresentations of fact to CIHLAR:
a.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The probability of pain relief from a robotic assisted abdominal neurolysis of
                                                                                                        the spermatic cord would be 70% to 80%.
b.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The probability of pain relief from a robotic assisted abdominal neurolysis of
                                                                                                                                                                                             the spermatic cord spermatic cord would increase by                                                                                           5% to                                                      10% if CIHLAR would
concurrently submit to a radical right orchiectomy.
c.                                                                                                      Failing to disclose more conservative courses of treatment such as local nerve
blocks.
d.                                                                                                      Failing to disclose pertinent risks of the procedure that could all result in long
term disability, such as nerve pain spread, nervous system overload, central nerve
sensitization, and windup.
e.                                                                                                      Recommending a radical right orchiectomy when there was no evidence of
testicle process causing CIHLAR' S pain.
41.                                                                                                     The misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 35 above may, as a matter of strict
interpretation, constitute opinions rather than statements of fact. However, under the facts of this
case, any such opinions rise to the level of material misstatements of fact for purposes of stating a

claim for fraud in the inducement. Mejia v. Jurich, 781 So. 2d 1175, 1177 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001).
42.                                                                                                     At all times material hereto PAREKATTIL knew or should have known the
misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 35 above were false.
43.                                                                                                     At all times material hereto PAREKATTIL intended for CIHLAR to rely upon the
misrepresentations.
44.                                                                                                     In justifiable reliance on the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph                   35 above
CIHLAR, has suffered permanent neurological damage, urological dysfunction, disfigurement, the
loss of a testicle, and other injuries yet to be determined.
WHEREFORE Plaintiff BRETT CIHLAR demands Judgment for damages against
Defendant SIJO PAREKATTIL, M.D. for compensatory damages, costs interest, and other such
relief as this Court deems just. CIHLAR further demands trial by jury.

47.                                                                                                     Under the doctrine of respondeat superior UFBOT is liable for all negligence of
PAREKATTIL so long as PAREKATTIL is acting in the course and scope of his employment with
UFBOT.
48.                                                                                                     At all times material hereto Defendant PAREKATTIL was acting within the course

provide CIHLAR with medical care and treatment in accordance with the prevailing standard of
professional care that is recognized and as acceptable by reasonably prudent health care providers in

the same or similar community. Jaar v. Univ. of Miami, 474 So. 2d 239, 245 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985)
50.                                                                                             With respect to the November                                                         23,   2009 procedure UFBOT, by and through

CIHLAR'S ilioinquinal and iliohypogastric nerves during the procedure, and as a direct a
proximate result of that failure, by causing permanent damage to said nerves with a surgical
instrument.
b.                                                                                              By failing to perform or order appropriate diagnostic testing prior to the
procedure that would have eliminated the spermatic cord as a source of pain, and would have
contraindicated the procedure altogether.
c.                                                                                              Otherwise failing to properly diagnose the source of CIHLAR'S complaints of
pain.

following the November 23, 2009 procedure were the result of injuries PAREKATTIL had
inflicted on CIHLAR during the November 29, 2009 procedure, when such recognition or
acknowledgement would have contraindicated the second procedure altogether.

b.                                                                                                Failing to perform or order appropriate diagnostic testing prior to the

a.                                                                                             Failing to take the necessary and proper precautions to protect and preserve
CIHLAR'S ilioinquinal and iliohypogastric nerves during the procedure, and as a direct a
proximate result of that failure, by causing permanent damage to said nerves with a surgical
instrument.
b.                                                                                             By failing to perform or order appropriate diagnostic testing prior to the
procedure that would have eliminated the spermatic cord as a source of pain, and would have
contraindicated the procedure altogether.

following the November 23, 2009 procedure were the result of injuries PAREKATTIL had
inflicted on CIHLAR during the November 29, 2009 procedure, when such recognition or
acknowledgement would have contraindicated the second procedure altogether.
b.                                                                                             Failing to perform or order appropriate diagnostic testing prior to the

standard of care, CIHLAR, has suffered permanent neurological damage, urological dysfunction,
disfigurement, the loss of a testicle, and other injuries yet to be determined.
63.                                                                                                    As a direct and proximate result of the negligence of PAREKATTIL, as imputed to
SHANDS, and as more particularly alleged above, CIHLAR suffered bodily injury and resulting pain
and suffering, disability or physical impairment, disfigurement, mental anguish, inconvenience, lost
earnings, loss of ability to earn income in the future, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life,
expense of hospitalization, and expense of medical and nursing care and treatment. The losses are

either permanent or continuing in nature and CIHLAR will suffer these losses in the future.

SHANDS, and as more particularly alleged above, CIHLAR suffered a catastrophic injury as defined
by Fla. Stat. § 766.118.
WHEREFORE Plaintiff BRETT CIHLAR demands Judgment for damages against
Defendant SHANDS for compensatory damages, costs interest, and other such relief as this Court
deems just. CIHLAR further demands trial by jury.

Brett Cihlar, claimant, who resides at                                                       350 New Port Drive, Apt.   1906, Naples, Florida
34114, notifies you pursuant to Fla. Stat.                                                   §                          766.106                                                                               (2), of his intent to initiate litigation
against you for medical malpractice. The claim for malpractice is based upon the
following facts and circumstances:
On November 22, 2009 Mr. Cihlar presented to you with right testicular pain. You
recommended a robotic neurolysis of the spermatic cord and advised Mr. Cihlar there
was a mere 10% chance the procedure would not relieve his pain. The following day,
November 23, 2009, you performed a robotic neurolysis of the spermatic cord on Mr.
Cihlar, but as it turns out Mr. Cihlar's testicular pain was caused by conditions wholly
unrelated to the spermatic cord. Consequently, the procedure you performed was neither
necessary nor appropriate, and your failure to test Mr. Cihlar for responsiveness to a
spermatic cord block or pudendal pain before performing the procedure constitutes a
failure to exercise reasonable care.
Following the November                                                                       23,                        2009 procedure Mr. Cihlar continued to complain of
increasing right testicular pain, along with newly developed symptoms of right groin and
f                                                                                            l                          ank pain. You recommended a robotic abdominal neurolysis of the spermatic cord with
a radical right orchiectomy, and performed the recommended procedure on March                1,
2010. Again you were negligent in performing this procedure without first testing Mr.
Cihlar for responsiveness to a spermatic cord nerve block or pudendal pain. However, in
addition to a lack of proper diagnostic testing, in performing the procedure you failed to
exercise reasonable care in two other respects. First you expressly represented to Mr.
Cihlar the chances of complete pain relief would improve by 5% to 10% if Mr. Cihlar's
healthy right testicle was removed. This representation runs contrary to the good practice
of urology. There is simply no medical basis for performing an orchiectomy to treat
orchialgia without any other evidence of testicular abnormality such as a positive
ultrasound. Second, you failed to exercise reasonable care by directly causing damage to
Mr. Cihlar's otherwise healthy ilioinguinal nerve with one or more surgical tools during
the procedure.
f                                                                                            f

As a result of the malpractice, claimant has suffering the following injuries:
Moderate to severe abdominal, groin, pelvic, hip and leg pain, severe pain during
urination and erections, loss of bladder filling sensation, moderate to severe dystonia,
ilioinguinal neuralgiadystonia, the loss of his right testicle resulting in an inability to
procreate, mental anguish, pain and suffering, resulting past and future expenses for
medical care and treatment, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, lost earnings, and
the loss of ability to earn money in the future.

against you for the medical malpractice of your agent, Sijo Parekattil, M.D. The claim for
malpractice is based upon the following facts and circumstances:
On November 22, 2009 Mr. Cihlar presented to Dr. Parekattil with right testicular pain.
Dr. Parekattil recommended a robotic neurolysis of the spermatic cord and advised Mr.
Cihlar there was a mere                                                                        10% chance the procedure would not relieve his pain. The
following day, November 23, 2009, Dr. Parekattil performed a robotic neurolysis of the
spermatic cord on Mr. Cihlar, but as it turns out Mr. Cihlar's testicular pain was caused
by conditions wholly unrelated to the spermatic cord. Consequently, the procedure Dr.
Parekattil performed was neither necessary nor appropriate, and Dr. Parekattil's failure to
test Mr. Cihlar for responsiveness to a spermatic cord block or pudendal pain before
performing the procedure constitutes a failure to exercise reasonable care.
Following the November                                                                         23,                                                                             2009 procedure Mr. Cihlar continued to complain of
increasing right testicular pain, along with newly developed symptoms of right groin and
f                                                                                              l                                                                               ank pain. Dr. Parekattil recommended a robotic abdominal neurolysis of the spermatic
cord with a radical right orchiectomy, and performed the recommended procedure on
March 1, 2010. Again Dr. Parekattil was negligent in performing this procedure without
first testing Mr. Cihlar for responsiveness to a spermatic cord nerve block or pudendal
pain. However, in addition to a lack of proper diagnostic testing, in performing the
procedure Dr. Parekattil failed to exercise reasonable card in two other respects. First Di.
Parekattil expressly represented to Mr. Cihlar the chances of complete pain relief would
improve by                                                                                     5% to                                                                           10% if Mr. Cihlar's healthy right testicle was removed. This
representation runs contrary to the good practice of urology. There is simply no medical
basis for performing an orchiectomy to treat orchialgia without any other evidence of
testicular abnormality such as a positive ultrasound. Second, Dr. Parekattil failed to
exercise reasonable care by directly causing damage to Mr. Cihlar's otherwise healthy
ilioinguinal nerve with one or more surgical tools during the procedure.

At all times material hereto Dr. Parekattil was serving as an agent for Shands Teaching
Hospital  and Clinics,  Inc.  d/b/a Shands  at the University of Florida                      (hereinafter
"Shands"), and all medical services more particularly described above were rendered by
Dr. Parekattil under the direct control and supervision of Shands.
As a result of the malpractice, claimant has suffering the following injuries:
Moderate to severe abdominal, groin, pelvic, hip and leg pain, severe pain during
urination and erections, loss of bladder filling sensation, moderate to severe dystonia,
ilioinguinal neuralgiadystonia, the loss of his right testicle resulting in an inability to
procreate, mental anguish, pain and suffering, resulting past and future expenses for
medical care and treatment, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, lost earnings, and
the loss of ability to earn money in the future.

Dr. Parekkatil recommended a robotic neurolysis of the spermatic cord and advised Mr.
Cihlar there was a mere                                                                        10% chance the procedure would not relieve his pain. The

AMENDED NOTICE OF INTENT TO INITIATE LITIGATION WITHOUT
PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED EXHIBITS
Claimant, Brett Cihlar, who resides at 350 New Port Drive, Apt.                                        1906, Naples, Florida 34114,
notifies you pursuant to Fla. Stat.                                                                    §                                                                            766.106   (2) and Fla. R. Civ. P.   1.650   (b), of his intent to
initiate litigation against Sijo Parekattil, Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc. d/b/a Shands
at the University of Florida ("Shands"), and the University of Florida Board of Trustees for
medical malpractice ("UF"). The claim for malpractice is based upon the following facts and
circumstances:
On November 22, 2009 Mr. Cihlar presented to Sijo Parekattil, M.D., individually, and as an
employee or agent of Shands and/or OF (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Dr. Parekattil")
with right orchialgia                                                                                  (testicular pain). During Mr. Cihlar's initial consultation Dr. Parekattil
recommended a robotic neurolysis of the spermatic cord (hereinafter "procedure") for relief of
Mr. Cihlar's pain, and expressly represented a                                                         90% chance of success. Dr. Parekattil never
ordered or performed any diagnostic testing to determine whether the procedure was appropriate.
Nevertheless, Dr. Parekattil performed the procedure on Mr. Cihlar the following day, November
23, 2010. The procedure was not successful. Mr. Cihlar's pain did not subside or diminish, and
subsequent testing by other health care providers confirms Mr. Cihlar's spermatic cord was never
a contributing factor to Mr. Cihlar's symptoms of pain. Consequently, the procedure Dr.
Parekattil performed was neither necessary nor appropriate, and Dr. Parekattil's failure to test
Mr. Cihlar for responsiveness to a spermatic cord block or pudendal pain prior to performing the
procedure constitutes a failure to exercise reasonable care. As an additional deviation from the

required standard of care, Dr. Parekattil failed to iake adequate precautions to protect Mr.
Cihlar's otherwise healthy ilioinguinal nerve during the procedure, and as a result damaged the
ilioinguinal nerve with a surgical instrument during the surgery.
Following the procedure Mr. Cihlar continued to complain of increasing right testicular pain,
along with  newly  developed  symptoms  of right groin and flank pain.  Dr.  Parekattil
recommended a robotic abdominal neurolysis of the spermatic cord with a radical right
orchiectomy (hereinafter "second procedure"), and performed the recommended procedure on
March 1, 2010. The second procedure was similarly inappropriate and unnecessary, and Dr.
Parekattil was again negligent in performing the second procedure without first testing Mr.
Cihlar for responsiveness to a spermatic cord nerve block or pudendal pain. However, in addition
to the foregoing deviations from the required standard of care, as an inducement for Mr. Cihlar
to consent to the second procedure, Dr. Parekattil expressly represented to Mr. Cihlar the
chances of complete pain relief would improve by 5% to 10% if Mr. Cihlar's unremarkable right
testicle was removed. This representation runs contrary to the good practice of urology. There is
simply no medical basis for performing an orchiectomy to treat testicular pain without any other
evidence of testicular abnormality such as a positive ultrasound. Accordingly, Dr. Parekattil
exceeded the scope of Mr. Cihlar's informed consent by performing the orchiectomy, and
alternatively was negligent for removing an unremarkable testicle for relief of pain.
As a result of the medical malpractice of Dr. Parekattil, individually and as employee or agent of
Shands and/or UF, Mr. Cihlar has suffered the following injuries:
Moderate to severe abdominal, groin, pelvic, hip and leg pain, severe pain during urination and
erections,  loss  of bladder  filling  sensation,  moderate  to  severe  dystonia,  ilioinguinal
neuralgiadystonia, the loss of his right testicle resulting in an inability to procreate, mental
anguish, pain and suffering, resulting past and future expenses for medical care and treatment,
loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, lost earnings, and the loss of ability to earn money in
the future.

The claim for
malpractice is based upon the following facts and circumstances:
On November 22, 2009 Mr. Cihlar presented to Sijo Parekattil, M.D., individually, and as an
employee or agent of OF (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Dr. Parekattil") with right
orchialgia (testicular pain). During Mr. Cihlar's initial consultation Dr. Parekattil recommended
a robotic neurolysis of the spermatic cord (hereinafter "procedure") for relief of Mr. Cihlar's
pain, and expressly represented a                                                                   90% chance of success. Dr. Parekattil never ordered or
performed  any  diagnostic  testing to  determine whether the procedure was appropriate.
Nevertheless, Dr. Parekattil performed the procedure on Mr. Cihlar the following day, November
23, 2010. The procedure was not successful. Mr. Cihlar's pain did not subside or diminish, and
subsequent testing by other health care providers confirm Mr. Cihlar's spermatic cord was never
a contributing factor to Mr. Cihlar's symptoms of pain. Consequently, the procedure Dr.
Parekattil performed was neither necessary nor appropriate, and Dr. Parekattil's failure to test
Mr. Cihlar for responsiveness to a spermatic cord block or pudendal pain prior to performing the
procedure constitutes a failure to exercise reasonable care. As an additional deviation from the

required standard of care, Dr. Parekattil failed to take adequate precautions to protect Mr.
Cihlar's otherwise healthy ilioinguinal nerve during the procedure, and as a result damaged the
ilioinguinal nerve with a surgical instrument during the surgery.
Following the procedure Mr. Cihlar continued to complain of increasing right testicular pain,
along  with newly  developed  symptoms  of right  groin and  flank pain.  Dr.  Parekattil
recommended a robotic abdominal neurolysis of the spermatic cord with a radical right
orchiectomy (hereinafter "second procedure"), and performed the recommended procedure on
March 1, 2010. The second procedure was similarly inappropriate and unnecessary, and Dr.
Parekattil was again negligent in performing the second procedure without first testing Mr.
Cihlar for responsiveness to a spermatic cord nerve block or pudendal pain. However, in addition
to the foregoing deviations from the required standard of care, as an inducement for Mr. Cihlar
to consent to the second procedure, Dr. Parekattil expressly represented to Mr. Cihlar the
chances of complete pain relief would improve by 5% to 10% if Mr. Cihlar's unremarkable right
testicle was removed. This representation runs contrary to the good practice of urology. There is
simply no medical basis for performing an orchiectomy to treat testicular pain without any other
evidence of testicular abnormality such as a positive ultrasound. Accordingly, Dr. Parekattil
exceeded the scope of Mr. Cihlar's informed consent by performing the orchiectomy, and
alternatively was negligent for removing an unremarkable testicle for relief of pain.
As a result of the medical malpractice of Dr. Parekattil, individually and as employee or agent of
UF, Mr. Cihlar has suffered the following injuries:
Moderate to severe abdominal, groin, pelvic, hip and leg pain, severe pain during urination and
erections,  loss  of bladder  filling  sensation,  moderate  to  severe  dystonia,  ilioinguinal
neuralgiadystonia, the loss of his right testicle resulting in an inability to procreate, mental
anguish, pain and suffering, resulting past and future expenses for medical care and treatment,
loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, lost earnings, and the loss of ability to earn money in
the future.
For the foregoing reasons claimant, Brett Cihlar demands compensation from UF for economic
and non-economic damages resulting from the injuries proximately caused by the negligence of
Dr. Parekattil.
