FACTS GIVING RISE TO CAUSE OF ACTION
17.                                                                                                        In January 2014, Mr. Poussard was experiencing flu-like symptoms, including
fever, chills, and fatigue.   Based on his prior medical history of aortic and mitral valve
replacements, Mr. Poussard was referred to cardiologist Defendant Dr. Grecul for evaluation and
treatment.
18.                                                                                                        Mr. Poussard first saw Dr. Grecul in his offices on January 24.  In light of Mr.
Poussard's aortic and mitral valve replacements and persistent symptoms, Dr. Grecul recognized
that Mr. Poussard could be suffering from bacterial infective endocarditis — a life-threatening

infection of the heart valves and inner lining of the heart.  Left untreated, bacterial infective
endocarditis can destroy a person's heart valves and cause death.
19.                                                                                                 Despite recognizing that Mr. Poussard was at great risk of endocarditis, Dr.
Grecul delayed two weeks before scheduling and performing a transesophageal echocardiogram
on February 6, 2014.
20.                                                                                                 The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed that Mr. Poussard in fact had aortic
valve endocarditis.  Dr. Grecul recognized and noted this diagnosis in his records, but did not
order any treatment.  Instead, Dr. Grecul referred Mr. Poussard to another cardiologist at Shands
Hospital for a second opinion.  Dr. Grecul made this referral without advising Mr. Poussard that
he required urgent care.
21.                                                                                                 Mr. Poussard was unable to obtain an appointment with the Shands Hospital
cardiologist until March 17, 2014. In the meantime, Mr. Poussard's life-threatening endocarditis
went untreated and progressed.
22.                                                                                                 Before Mr. Poussard could attend his scheduled cardiology appointment, on
March 4,                                                                                            2014, Mr. Poussard began experiencing stroke-like symptoms and went to the
emergency room at Holmes Regional for treatment.
23.                                                                                                 Mr. Poussard went to Holmes Regional because he believed Holmes Regional
was capable of treating his condition.  He did not attempt to secure physicians on his own, but
accepted the physicians and medical staff that were provided to him by Holmes Regional when
he arrived.   Mr. Poussard allowed himself to be treated by these doctors as he had no choice
with respect to the selection of the emergency room and admitting physicians and medical staff.

24.                                                                                                  At Holmes Regional, Mr. Poussard was first seen by Dr. Vicente, a neurologist.
Dr. Vicente evaluated Mr. Poussard, but failed to inquire or to recognize his medical history and
failed to recognize his embolic stroke symptoms as a major complication of bacterial infective
endocarditis.
25.                                                                                                  Mr. Poussard was then admitted to the care of internal medicine doctor, Dr.
Lorente.   Dr. Lorente also failed to recognize Mr. Poussard's stroke symptoms as a major
complication of bacterial infective endocarditis.
26.                                                                                                  Eventually, both Drs. Lorente and Vicente learned of Mr. Poussard's medical
history.  Specifically, they learned that Mr. Poussard had heart valve replacements and that he
had undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram with Dr. Grecul, which had shown a mass on
the prosthetic aortic valve.
27.                                                                                                  But,  even with this knowledge, Drs.  Lorente and Vicente did not seek to
determine whether Mr. Poussard was suffering from endocarditis and its major complications.
They did not review the results of Mr. Poussard's echocardiogram or order blood cultures, which
would have revealed the bacterial infective endocarditis.   Instead, Drs. Vicente and Lorente,
deferred to the treatment of Dr. Grecul.
28.                                                                                                  For his part, Dr. Grecul saw Mr. Poussard in the hospital, but did not order any
treatment for endocarditis, notwithstanding his earlier diagnosis and Mr. Poussard's persistent
symptoms. Nor did Dr. Grecul order any additional tests to confirm that diagnosis or order any
physician consultations. Rather, Dr. Grecul initiated anticoagulation therapy, which did not treat
Mr. Poussard's endocarditis.

Mr. Poussard's endocarditis was initiated and on March                                                 6,                                                                                             2014, Drs. Grecul, Vicente, and
Lorente all agreed that Mr. Poussard should be released from the hospital.
30.                                                                                                    Left untreated, Mr. Poussard's endocarditis continued to worsen. Eight days after
Mr. Poussard's hospital discharge, on March                                                            14, 2014, Mr. Poussard again went to Holmes
Regional with stroke-like symptoms as a major complication of bacterial infective endocarditis.
31.                                                                                                    During this March                                                                              14 visit, Mr. Poussard was treated in the emergency room,
where blood cultures were ordered.
32.                                                                                                    Once again, Mr. Poussard was treated at Holmes Regional by Defendant Dr.
Lorente.   In addition, Mr. Poussard was treated by Dr. Mitra, another internal medicine
specialist, and by Dr. Polanco, a cardiologist.   These doctors also failed to properly test Mr.
Poussard's symptoms and diagnose his endocarditis.
33.                                                                                                    Specifically, although blood cultures were obtained, Defendant Drs. Lorente,
Mitra and Polanco, failed to inquire as to the results of those tests. And, although a transthoracic
echocardiogram was performed on Mr. Poussard on March 15, Defendant Drs. Lorente, Mitra
and Polanco did not review the results of this test.
34.                                                                                                    Then, on March 16, 2014, Drs. Lorente, Mitra and Polanco all agreed to release
Mr. Poussard, without determining the results of the diagnostic testing, without calling for

not call Mr. Poussard to return to the hospital for treatment or even to relay these results.
Accordingly, Mr. Poussard's already serious condition continued to worsen, untreated.

Shands Hospital.
37.                                                                                                  At Shands Hospital, more blood cultures were ordered and Mr. Poussard was
released with instructions to follow-up with Dr. Grecul. However, when a Shands Hospital
cardiologist received the results of the blood cultures later that same day on March 17, he called
Mr. Poussard back to the hospital urgently to be admitted and to be treated with intravenous
antibiotics.
38.                                                                                                  Once back at Shands, although Mr. Poussard was thought to be suffering from
endocarditis, a life-threatening disease, he was not treated urgently.   An additional diagnostic
transesophageal echocardiogram was delayed for several days until March 21.
39.                                                                                                  The transesophageal echocardiogram performed at Shands Hospital confirmed a
bacterial endocarditis diagnosis and showed an extension of the infection as compared to the
February 6 echocardiogram. But, still, Mr. Poussard's treatment was delayed. Mr. Poussard was
not seen by Shands surgical consultants until March 22, and he did not ultimately undergo
surgery until April 1.
40.                                                                                                  By the time Mr. Poussard underwent surgery it was too late to save his life. As a
result of the delayed diagnosis and treatment, the infection had progressed significantly and
caused devastating damage to his heart. Mr. Poussard died the day after his surgery, on April 2,
2014.

CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT HEALTH FIRST, INC.
VICARIOUS LIABILITY FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OF
SUDESHNA MITRA, M.D. (APPARENT AGENCY)
89.                                                                                                    The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 40 and 83 through 85 and
further alleges:
90.                                                                                                    Dr. Mitra was the apparent agent of Defendant Health First, Inc. and was acting
within the scope of her apparent agency at all relevant times.
91.                                                                                                    As alleged above, Health First, Inc. by its words or conduct caused or allowed Mr.
Poussard to believe that its physicians, including Dr. Mitra, were an integral part of Health First,
Inc. and were their agents with the authority to act for Health First, Inc.
92.                                                                                                    Health First, Inc. held Holmes Regional out to the public, including Mr. Poussard,
as providing a broad spectrum of emergency medical care. Mr. Poussard went to Holmes
Regional because he believed Holmes Regional was capable of treating his emergency condition.
He did not attempt to secure physicians on his own, but accepted the physicians that were
provided to him by Health First, Inc. and allowed himself to be treated by them.  Health First,
Inc. provided Mr. Poussard with physicians without any input or choice exercised by Mr.
Poussard.
93.                                                                                                    In accepting treatment and services  from the doctors  at Holmes  Regional,
including Dr. Mitra, Mr. Poussard justifiably relied upon the belief that they were agents of
Health First, Inc. and that Health First, Inc. would be responsible for their negligence, which
occurred while they were acting within the scope of their apparent authority to provide
healthcare services on behalf of Health First, Inc.
