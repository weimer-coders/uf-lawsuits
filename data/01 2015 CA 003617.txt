that became infected. Even after the infection resolved, the facial pain that remained

permanently was excruciating and interfered with the major life activities of eating, speaking,
sleeping, concentrating, and walking  Plaintiff is a qualified person with a disability.
16.                                                                                                      In March 2011, Plaintiff began treatment at the University of Florida Pain Clinic.
Her pain was significantly reduced by following the treatment prescribed by Dr. Hurley at that
clinic, and she continued to follow his treatment recommendations at all times relevant to the
complaint.
17.                                                                                                      Treatment of Plaintiffs condition requires Kohn to take prescription medication.
Dr. Hurley assured her that the treatment should not interfere with her ability to do her job. In
fact the prescribed treatment did not affect Plaintiff's ability to fulfill the essential functions of
her job.
18.                                                                                                      On March 14, 2014, Mahla and Lynne Meyer, OF College of Medicine Medical
Educator, came into Plaintiff's office while she was at work and Mahla accused the Plaintiff of
being impaired at work. Plaintiff was directed by Dr. Mahla to go directly to the Shands
Occupational Health for a urine test. She was not informed by Shands of the reasons for the
"reasonable suspicion" testing, but Mahla told her that she was displaying signs of intoxication.
After her test Plaintiff was directed to leave the worksite, even though it was apparent that she
would be driving herself home.
19.                                                                                                      The results of the drug screen were negative except for the medications she was
prescribed by Dr. Hurley; nevertheless, she was suspended from her position at Shands and
required to attend an evaluation with Markus Dietrich, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and
Director of the Employee Assistance Program at Shands. Plaintiff was required to use accrued
leave during the suspension.

20.                                                                                                 On April 9, 2014, Dietrich wrote a letter to Shands Occupational Health clearing
Plaintiff to return to work. Plaintiff was required to limit her working hours to 40 per week,
continue counseling with her regular counselor, and meet with Dietrich as scheduled.
21.                                                                                                 When the Plaintiff returned to work on April 15, 2014, she learned that she had a
new job description and a new supervisor, Lynne Meyer, who was still a OF College of Medicine
employee. Meyer gave Plaintiff an Employee Development Plan with strict requirements. On
May 27, 2014, Plaintiff was given a documented verbal warning. Plaintiff's co-workers were
told that they should not associate with her. It became abundantly clear that the plan was to
document minor deficiencies to justify her termination.
22.                                                                                                 Plaintiff tried her best to meet the new job requirements while being limited to
working 40 hours per week. On June 15, 2014, feeling that she was being set-up for termination,
Plaintiff initiated a meeting with Dr. Flynn, Senior Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, and her
supervisor for many years. Plaintiff told Dr. Flynn of the problems she had been experiencing.
A few days later, Plaintiff met with Cindy Seidman, her Shands supervisor, and Seidman
informed the Plaintiff that Mahla and Flynn wanted her to take FMLA leave and see how her
medications were affecting her.
23.                                                                                                 Acting on that advice, Plaintiff presented a FMLA leave request to Meyer on June
26, 2014. Meyer and Mahla expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that plaintiff was requesting
only intermittent FMLA leave and told the Plaintiff that she should take twelve weeks of full
leave. The conversation culminated with Dr. Mahla telling the Plaintiff that "we all know you
are on prescription medications and the same thing that was wrong with you in March is still
wrong with you." After a short delay, Mahla and Meyer returned the approved leave form to the
Plaintiff while informing her that it would not stop them from firing her.

24. On July 1, 2014, Meyer informed the Plaintiff that she was terminated after Plaintiff
refused to resign. Plaintiff did not receive any notification from Shands other than a COBRA
letter a few weeks later.
