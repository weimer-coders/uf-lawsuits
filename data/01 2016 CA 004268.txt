1.                                                                                           This is an action for damages in excess of $15,000.00, exclusive of interest, costs, and
attorneys' fees.
2.                                                                                           Venue is proper as the alleged negligence in this matter occurred in Alachua County,
Florida, and the Defendants reside and/or conduct business in Alachua County, Florida.
3.                                                                                           All statutorily required conditions precedent to the maintenance of this action have been
performed, have occurred, or have been waived.  All requirements of applicable Florida
Statutes have timely been complied with prior to the filing of this action, to include
providing notice pursuant to Florida Statute 768.28.
4.                                                                                           There has been a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are grounds for a
good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care and treatment rendered by the
Defendants in this case, which gives rise to this action.   As part of that reasonable
investigation, Plaintiffs served Defendants, SHANDS TEACHING HOSPITAL AND
CLINICS, INC. d/b/a/ SHANDS HOSPITAL; UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA BOARD OF
TRUSTEES d/b/a OF HEALTH YOUNG WOMEN; SHARON YOUNG BYUN, MD;
JULINE M. DEEN, MD; ASHLEY C. WALSH, MD; SHIREEN MADANI SIMS, MD;

ROCHELLE WILSON, MD;   and AMY GRZYWA, ARNP with Notices of Intent to
Initiate Medical Malpractice Litigation pursuant to Chapter 766, Florida Statutes.
5.                                                                                             This action is being brought prior to AURORA PRICE's eighth birthday and in accordance
with Florida Statute 95.11(4)(b) and is not barred by any statute of limitations.
6.                                                                                             MIRANDA E. PRICE and JOHN GARRETT PRICE only recently became aware that
there was a reasonable possibility that AURORA PRICE'S injuries were the result of
medical malpractice.  In accordance with Tanner v. Hartog, 618 So. 2d 177 (Fla. 1993),
the statute of limitations did not begin to run until MIRANDA E. PRICE and JOHN
GARRETT PRICE became aware of such reasonable possibility. Therefore, this claim is
not barred by the statute of limitations.

FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM
32.                                                                                        MIRANDA E. PRICE became pregnant in 2011 and commenced prenatal care with
SHARON  YOUNG  BYUN  at OF  Health  Women's  Center-Springhill.  This  was
MIRANDA E. PRICE' s first pregnancy.
33.                                                                                        During her pregnancy, Mrs. PRICE suffered from preeclampsia, including elevated blood
pressure, pitting edema, and proteinuria.
34.                                                                                        On April 18, 2012, Ms. PRICE presented to SHANDS HOSPITAL with complaints of loss
of fluid. MS. PRICE was evaluated by SHARON YOUNG BYUN, MD, and was noted to
have abnormal fetal monitoring, abnormal irregular contractions, as well as evidence of
early onset preeclampsia. Despite these conditions and her prenatal history, she was not
admitted to the hospital. Furthermore, Ms. PRICE was not given proper and appropriate
discharge instructions.
35.                                                                                        On April 23, 2012, Ms. PRICE presented to SHARON YOUNG BYUN, MD's Office. Dr.
BYUN noted concern for possible macrosomia. Despite this concern, Dr. BYUN failed to
7

advise MS. PRICE of proper and appropriate options for labor and delivery, to include
recommendation of a Cesarean Section and/or admission to the hospital. MS. PRICE was
allowed to advance past 41 weeks gestation.
36.                                                                                       On May 4, 2012, Ms. PRICE presented to SHANDS HOSPITAL for induction of labor.
The admitting physician of record was DAVID S. ANDRE STEWART, MD. Upon
admission to SHANDS HOSPITAL, Ms. PRICE received medical care and treatment from
labor and delivery nurses Janine Allen Mclnturf, RN; Anna Grace Walker, RN; Yael
Zaidel, RN; Nurse Moody, RN; and Nurse Brogan, RN.
37.                                                                                       Upon admission, Misoprostol/Cytotec was ordered by JULINE M. DEEN, MD for
induction of labor and administered by NATALIA PRIETO, ARNP and ASHLEY C.
WALSH, MD.
38.                                                                                       Misoprostol/Cytotec used for induction of labor is an "off-label" use and expressly warned
against by the drug's manufacturer. At the time Misoprostol/Cytotec was administered to
Ms. PRICE it was documented and known to cause multiple medical problems if used for
labor induction.
39.                                                                                       Misoprostol/Cytotec has a "black box" warning which states that it should not be used by
pregnant patients, and that it may cause maternal/fetal injury. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has not approved Misoprostol/Cytotec for induction of labor.
40.                                                                                       Ms. PRICE was never provided proper informed consent regarding the warnings and
contraindications  of Misoprostol/Cytotec.  Furthermore,  this  drug was  ordered and
administered at various times despite it being contraindicated given Ms. PRICE's
preeclampsia, elevated blood pressure, non-reassuring fetal surveillance, cephalopelvic
disproportion and macrosomia.

41.                                                                                        Upon the administration of Misoprostol/Cytotec, Ms. PRICE began to experience elevated
blood pressure and uterine hyperstimulation and tachysystole.
42.                                                                                        On May 5, 2012, Oxytocin/Pitocin was ordered and continually administered, despite being
contraindicated. Ms. PRICE continued to experience elevated blood pressure and uterine
hyperstimulation and tachysystole.
43.                                                                                        Following the administration of Misoprostol/Cytotec and Oxytocin/Pitocin, the external
Fetal  Heart Monitor  showed signs  of fetal  distress  to  include repetitive variable
decelerations, minimal to absent variability, as well as repetitive and prolonged late
decelerations. Despite the same, intrauterine resuscitative measures were not timely
initiated, and a C-section was not discussed, recommended or ordered.
44.                                                                                        At 6:14 a.m., Ms. PRICE's blood pressure worsened to a critical reading of 171/98. After
evaluating Ms. PRICE, ASHLEY C. WALSH, MD ordered Magnesium.
45.                                                                                        At or around 2:13 p.m., JONA BANDYOPADHYAY, MD was notified of the non-
                                                                                           reassuring fetal heart surveillance. Despite non-reassuring fetal heart tracings, ASHLEY
                                                                                           C. WALSH, MD, SHIREEN MADANI SIMS, MD, and JONA BANDYOPADHYAY,
                                                                                           MD continued to administer Oxytocin/Pitocin.
46.                                                                                        At 5:15 p.m., Ms. Price began pushing.
47.                                                                                        At or around 7:10 p.m., a shoulder dystocia was encountered. SHIREEN MADANI SIMS,
MD performed several maneuvers in an attempt to relieve the shoulder dystocia to include
McRoberts, super pubic pressure, Wood Screw, Rubin Screw. These maneuvers were
initially unsuccessful.
48.                                                                                        AURORA PRICE was delivered at 7:16 p.m. and was noted to have a nuchal cord.

49.                                                                                          Upon delivery, AURORA PRICE had no respiratory effort, and was described as limp, and
pale. Her APGARs at the time of her birth were 1 at one (1) minute of life, 3 at five (5)
minutes of life; and 4 at ten (10) minutes of life.
50.                                                                                          AURORA PRICE was intubated at eight (8) minutes of life and subsequently transferred
to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where she received care and treatment from
ROCHELLE WILSON, MD; SANDRA E. SULLIVAN, MD; DONALD J. FILLIPPS,
MD; DONALD E. KNICKERBOCKER, MD; AMY GRZYWA, ARNP; and MARTHA
V. DOUGLAS-ESCOBAR, MD. These healthcare providers were not privately retained
by AURORA PRICE or her parents.
51.                                                                                          AURORA PRICE was admitted to the NICU for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and
was noted to have elevated magnesium levels. Despite this admission, the physicians,
residents, nurses, and staff failed to timely initiate therapeutic hypothermia protocols.
52.                                                                                          A Brain MRI imaged on May 9, 2012, revealed findings consistent with global hypoxic
brain injury.
53.                                                                                          On June 13, 2012, AURORA Price was discharged from the NICU.
54.                                                                                          As a result of Defendants' negligence, AURORA PRICE suffered and continues to suffer
from severe and permanent injuries to include a hypoxic brain injury, global developmental
delay, seizures, blurred vision, language delay, and required a g-tube for feeding.
COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE OF SHANDS HOSPITAL FOR BREACH OF NON-
DELEGABLE DUTY
Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 54 above as though
fully set forth herein and further alleges the following:
10

55.                                                                                               At all times hereto, Defendant SHANDS HOSPITAL had a non-delegable duty to provide
qualified and competent medical staff to provide pre-delivery, post-delivery and neonatal
care and treatment to MIRANDA E. PRICE and AURORA PRICE.
56.                                                                                               When a facility, such as SHANDS HOSPITAL, undertakes to perform services, it cannot
transfer the obligation to perform those services to independent contractors, and remains
responsible for the negligence of their contractors!
57.                                                                                               Generally, if a responsibility is so important to the community, the original party should
not be allowed to transfer it to a third party.2
58.                                                                                               At all times material hereto, the Defendant, SHANDS HOSPITAL, had a non-delegable
duty to provide timely and appropriate medical care to MIRANDA E. PRICE and
AURORA PRICE in accordance with the general standard of care for providing care and
treatment to pregnant patients.
59.                                                                                               Stated simply, the performance of a duty may be delegated to a third party; however,
liability for the negligent performance of that duty may not be delegated away to a
third party. The policy behind such a rule contemplates that certain duties that are of
utmost importance—namely, the protection of people placed in positions of vulnerability
coupled with a relationship of special trust. In this case, the duty of the hospital to protect
a vulnerable infant during labor, delivery, and post-delivery.
60.                                                                                               Under the law defining a non-delegable duty, a party who has an obligation to perform acts
or who has undertaken certain duties has the obligation to perform those acts and duties in
a non-negligent fashion. If the party chooses to delegate those acts to a third party—i.e.,
'Cited from Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions §§ 402.9
'Pope v. Winter Park Healthcare Group. Ltd., 939 So.2d 185, 188 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006).
11

an independent contractor—the original party remains liable for any negligence of that
third party—regardless of whether the negligent act was performed by an agent or
independent contractor.   See generally Newbold-Ferguson v. AMISUB                                (North Ridge
Hosp.), Inc., 85 So. 3d 502 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012); Shands Teaching Hosp. & Clinic, Inc. v.
Juliana, 863 So. 2d 343,349 (Fla. 1st DCA 2003); Irving v. Doctor's Hosp. of Lake Worth,
Inc., 415 So.2d 55 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982) (holding that where the physician is not privately
retained by the patient and his activities are controlled by the hospital, courts have held
hospitals liable under theories of non-delegable duty).
61.                                                                                               The seminal case on non-delegable duty is Irving v. Doctor's Hosp. of Lake Worth, Inc.,
415 So. 2d 55 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982). In Irving, the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed
a trial court's jury verdict for failing to instruct a jury on the issue of non-delegable duty.
See id. The Plaintiff in Irving was presented to the emergency department and the treating
physician was not a hospital employee. Id. The Court upheld the non-delegable duty owed
by the hospital for care rendered by an emergency room physician who was an independent
contractor, reasoning:
[the plaintiff] took her child to the emergency room of [the hospital]
for treatment. As far as she was concerned, all of the personnel
furnished in the emergency room were hospital employees. The
hospital held itself out as affording emergency treatment and the
jury could well find that [the plaintiff] was dealing with the hospital.
Thus, [. . .] the evidence in this case would justify a jury verdict in
[the plaintiff's] favor on the theory of apparent authority whether
[the  treating physician was]  an  employee  or an  independent
contractor. Failure to so instruct the jury deprived them of the court's
advice on an important aspect of [the plaintiff's case]. Indeed, that
oversight might well account for the adverse verdict.
62.                                                                                               The court then focused on the jury instructions given by the Trial Court noting "[t]he thrust
of [the plaintiff's requested] instruction is that one may not escape his contractual liability
12

by delegating performance under a contract to an independent contractor. The contracting
party remains liable for the negligent performance of the contract whether it be performed
for him by his employee or an independent contractor." Id. at 59.
63.                                                                                                                    Following this logic, the Irving Court pointed out in footnote [2]:
Having undertaken the treatment of the patient, which including
providing physicians to care for the patient, the hospital was under
a duty to do so effectively and patients entering the hospital through
the emergency department could safely assume that the treating
doctors were acting on behalf of the hospital providing the care. It
was not incumbent on the patient to be aware of each and every
private contract between the hospital and the physicians. Id. at 60-
61 .
64.                                                                                                                    The physicians and staff rendering care to MIRANDA E. PRICE and AURORA PRICE at
SHANDS HOSPITAL, including but not limited to SHARON YOUNG BYUN, MD;
JULINE M. DEEN, MD; ASHLEY C. WALSH, MD; SHIREEN MADANI SIMS, MD;
DAVID S. ANDRE STEWART, MD; JONA BANDYOPADHYAY, MD; NATALIA

ROCHELLE WILSON, MD; AMY GRZYWA, ARNP; Janine Allen Mclnturf, RN; Anna
Grace Walker, RN; Yael Zaidel, RN; Nurse Moody, RN; and Nurse Brogan, RN, were not
privately retained by AURORA PRICE or her parents, and their activities were controlled
by SHANDS HOSPITAL. See Irving v. Doctor's Hospital of Lake Worth, Inc., 415 So.2d
55 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982); See also Shands Teaching Hosp. and Clinic, Inc. v. Juliana, 863
So.                                                                                                                    2d 343, 349 (Fla.                                                                 1st DCA 2003) (citing Hippocrates Mertsaris v.   73rd Corp.,105
3 Holding that where the physician is not privately retained by the patient and his activities are controlled by the
hospital, courts have held hospitals liable under theories of non-delegable duty.)

A.D.2d 67, 482 N.Y.S.2d 792, 801( N.Y. 1984)); See also Newbold-Ferguson v. AMISUB
(North Ridge Hospital), Inc., 85 So. 3d 502, 505 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012).
65.                                                                                             The Plaintiffs had no reason to believe that the doctors and medical staff providing care
and treatment to MIRANDA E. PRICE and/or AURORA PRICE were anything other than
medical providers assigned to them by SHANDS HOSPITAL. As in Irving, where the
independent contractor status of the physician was not a defense available to the hospital,
so too is the defense not available to the Defendants in this case.
66.                                                                                             After the Irving decision, the Fifth District Court of Appeal addressed the issues arising
out of claims non-delegable duty in Orlando Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Chmielewski, 573 So. 2d
876 (Fla. 5th DCA 1990), abrogated on other grounds, Boulis v. Fla. Dep't of Transp., 733
So.2d 959 (Fla.                                                                                 1999). In Chmielewski, the facts revealed a patient entered the emergency
room of a local hospital to receive treatment, and as a result of the treatment which alleged
to have been negligent was injured. Id. at 878.
67.                                                                                             The Fifth District Court ruled that the trial court committed no error, noting that the jury
instruction given in Chmielewski was "essentially a correct statement of the law." Id. That
jury instruction, which began with                                                              [then] Florida Standard Jury Instruction                                                       3.3b(2)
followed by the bracketed independent contractor instruction of 3.3b(1), also included an
instruction which stated:
Even if you were to find that Dr. Aparicio was an independent
contractor, the hospital would nevertheless be responsible for any
negligence on his part if Mr. Chmielewski went to the hospital for
hospital treatment and the Defendant hospital undertook to treat him
for a charge and to furnish doctors and staff to render that treatment.
Id. at 878.
68.                                                                                             The Florida Standard Jury Instruction regarding non-delegable duties for treatment
provides in relevant part:
14

. . . When a facility undertakes to perform services, he/she/it cannot transfer
the obligation to perform those services to an independent contractor and
remains responsible for the negligence of his/her independent contractor.
See Florida Standard Jury Instruction 402.9(a)(1).
69.                                                                                              After the Chmielewski opinion, the First District Court of Appeal decided Shands Teaching
Hosp. & Clinic v. Juliana, 863 So. 2d 343(Fla. 1st DCA 2003). In Juliana, the court found
that the hospital was liable for the negligent acts of a perfusionist after a child was rushed
to the emergency department and needed to have open heart surgery and suffered an injury
during the procedure attributable, at least in part, to the acts of the perfusionist. In doing
so, the First District Court of Appeal noted:
The duty could not be delegated since the service was contracted
for. The hospital provided the services of the perfusionist. If the
hospital had wished for the patient to obtain his own perfusionist it
might have been possible to advise the patient that this was his
responsibility. This certainly was not done. The fact that the hospital
chose to retain the services of the perfusionist as an independent
contractor rather than an employee is immaterial in the relationship
between the hospital and the patient. Id.
70.                                                                                              Furthermore, in footnote 9 of its opinion, the First District Court of Appeal again stated
the basic rule on non-delegable duty for physicians at hospitals:
Even when a physician is an independent contractor, however,
hospital that "undertake by [express or implied] contract to do for
another a given thing" is not allowed to escape within its contract
liability to the patient by delegating performance under a contract to
an  independent  contractor                                                                      (citing to  Irving  and  Chmielewski
(internal citations omitted)).
71.                                                                                              This well settled legal concept of non-delegable duty was more recently reaffirmed in
Newbold-Ferguson v. AMISUB (North Ridge Hospital), Inc., 85 So. 3d 502 (Fla. 4th DCA
2012). Newbold-Ferguson was a wrongful death action alleging negligence on the part of
an emergency room physician, and an attempt to hold a hospital liable for that physician's
negligence. See id. After the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's third
15

amended complaint, the Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's ruling.
Id. In doing so, it was explained the public policy purpose behind imposing a non-delegable
duty on hospital emergency situations is that:
[t]he imposition of a non-delegable duty to provide competent
emergency services makes sense, because a patient in an emergency
generally has little, if any, control over who will be the treating
physician.   This is further evidenced by the Hospital's website
where it makes advertisements to the public regarding its medical
services  and  offers  these  services  to  the  public  upon  their
presentation to the Hospital's facility. Any patient who then presents
to the Hospital is accepting the Hospital's representations as true.
Id.
72.                                                                                           The Plaintiffs in this case similarly had no control over who their treating physicians were,
nor were they privately retained by the Plaintiffs.   Instead, the physicians and staff
rendering care and treatment to MIRANDA E. PRICE and/or AURORA PRICE, including
but not limited to, SHARON YOUNG BYUN, MD; JULINE M. DEEN, MD; ASHLEY
C. WALSH, MD; SHIREEN MADANI SIMS, MD; DAVID S. ANDRE STEWART, MD;
JONA  BANDYOPADHYAY,  MD;  NATALIA  PRIETO,  ARNP;  MARTHA  V.
DOUGLAS-ESCOBAR,   MD;   DONALD   J.   FILLIPPS,   MD;   DONALD   E.
KNICKERBOCKER, MD; SANDRA E. SULLIVAN, MD; ROCHELLE WILSON, MD;
AMY GRZYWA, ARNP; Janine Allen Mclnturf, RN; Anna Grace Walker, RN; Yael
Zaidel, RN; Nurse Moody, RN; and Nurse Brogan, RN, were provided by, and under the
control of, SHANDS HOSPITAL, thus creating a non-delegable duty.
73. This non-delegable duty was breached by SHANDS HOSPITAL in the following ways:
(A) Through the negligence of their employees, staff, residents, physicians, agents,
and/or apparent agents including, but not limited to, SHARON YOUNG BYUN,
MD; JULINE M. DEEN, MD; ASHLEY C. WALSH, MD; SHIREEN MADANI
SIMS, MD; DAVID S. ANDRE STEWART, MD; JONA BANDYOPADHYAY,

E. SULLIVAN, MD; ROCHELLE WILSON, MD; AMY GRZYWA, ARNP;
Janine Allen Mclnturf, RN; Anna Grace Walker, RN; Yael Zaidel, RN; Nurse
Moody, RN; and Nurse Brogan, RN, as these providers breached their duty of care
owed to AURORA PRICE, as follows:
a. Failing to provide timely and appropriate medical care and treatment to
MIRANDA E. PRICE and/ or AURORA PRICE;
b. Ordering and administering Misoprostol/Cytotec to Plaintiff, MIRANDA E.
PRICE;
c. Negligently  ordering  and  administering  Oxytocin/Pitocin  to  Plaintiff,
MIRANDA E. PRICE;
d. Failing to warn the Plaintiff, MIRANDA E. PRICE, that Misoprostol/Cytotec
was not approved by the FDA for labor induction usage;
e. Failing to advise MIRANDA E. PRICE, of the known complications of
Cytotec if used for labor induction;
f. Failing to timely and appropriately treat hypertension and preeclampsia;
g. Failing to timely identify, report and/or treat non-reassuring fetal heart
