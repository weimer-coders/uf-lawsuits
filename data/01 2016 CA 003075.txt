SUMMARY OF CLAIMS
23.                                                                                                   VESTAL contends that,  under the provisions of Chapter                           766, the pre-suit
screening period and the applicable statute of limitations were repeatedly extended or tolled, as
to all potential defendants, by the PINCUS NOI, the UFBOT NOI, the NOIs to PETERS,
BADARI, BAINES and STEPHENS and the NOIs to the UFBOT agents/employees.
24.                                                                                                   SHANDS, UFBOT, PINCUS, PETERS, BADARI, BAINES and STEPHENS
contend, however, that due to the "legal relationship" between them within the meaning of Rule
Rule 1.650(b)(1), Fla. R. Civ. P., VESTAL's initial NOI to SHANDS dated May 13, 2015 is the
operative Chapter 766 notice of intent and that none of the subsequent notices of intent sent to
PINCUS,   UFBOT,   PETERS,   BADARI,   BAINES,   STEPHENS   and   the   UFBOT
agents/employees, further extended or tolled either the pre-suit screening period or the applicable
statute of limitations.
25.                                                                                                   There is a real, actual and present controversy between the parties concerning
whether the PINCUS NOI, the UFBOT NOI, the NOIs to PETERS, BADARI, BAINES and
STEPHENS and the NOIs to the UFBOT agents/employees further extended or tolled the pre-
suit screening period or the statute of limitations which applies to the Action.

alleged above.

determine and declare the rights of UFBOT, and the duties and obligations of VESTAL, under
the provisions of Rule 1.650(b)(1), Fla. R. Civ. P. and Chapter 766, Florida Statutes.
28.                                                                                                     VESTAL's May 13, 2015 NOI to SHANDS stated that VESTAL intended to
"initiate litigation medical malpractice claims against University of Florida Board of Trustees,
Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc. d/b/a Shands Hospital, its agents, staff, nurses,
ARNP's, residents, and physicians including, but not limited to; David Pincus, M.D., for the
negligent care and treatment provided to Victoria Vestal". See Exhibit "C".
29.                                                                                                     Under the provisions of Rule                                                            1.650   (b)(1), Fla. R. Civ. P., a "notice of intent to
initiate litigation sent by certified mail and received by any prospective defendant shall operate
as notice to the person and any other prospective defendant who bears a legal relationship to the
prospective defendant receiving the notice."
30.                                                                                                     There is a "legal relationship" between SHANDS and UFBOT within the
meaning of Rule 1.650(b)(1), Fla. R. Civ. P., such that the May 13, 2015 NOI to SHANDS also
constitutes Chapter 766 notice to UFBOT.
31.                                                                                                     UFBOT is uncertain whether the May 13, 2015 NOI to SHANDS also constitutes
Chapter 766 notice to UFBOT such that the 90-day pre-suit screening period applicable to both

functioning.   V1CTORIA's extremity strength was markedly deficient, and her motor
responses were unable to be assessed, which indicated neurological dysfunction and
decline.

acts of who has undertaken certain duties has the obligation to perform those acts and
duties in a non-negligent fashion.  If the party chooses to delegate those acts to a third
party—i.e..  an  independent  contractor   the  original  party  remains  liable  for  any
negligence of that third party- - regardless of whether the negligent act was performed by

reversed a trial court's jury verdict for failing to instruct a jury on the issue of non-
delegable duty. See id. The Plaintiff in Irving was presented to the emergency department
9

and the treating physician was not a hospital employee. Id. The Court upheld the non-
delegable duty owed by the hospital for care rendered by an emergency room physician
whowas an independent contractor, reasoning:
t                                                                                             h                                                                                       e plaintiff] took her child to the emergency room of   [the
hospital] for treatment. As far as she was concerned. all of the
personnel  furnished  in  the  emergency  room  were  hospital
employees. The hospital held itself out as affording emergency
treatment and the jury could well find that                                                   [the plaintiff] was
dealing with the hospital. Thus,                                                              [.                                                                                      .j the evidence in this case
would justify a jury verdict in                                                               [the plaintiffs] favor on the theory
of apparent authority whether                                                                 [the treating physician  was]  an
employee or an independent contractor. Failure to so instruct the
jury deprived them of the court's advice on an important aspect of
[the plaintiffs easel. indeed, that oversight might well account for
the adverse verdict.
58.                                                                                           The court then focused on the jury instructions given by the Trial Court noting "Mlle
thrust of [the plaintiffs requested  instruction is that one may not escape his contractual
liability by delegating performance under a contract to an independent contractor. The
contracting party remains liable rot the negligent performance of the contract whether it
be performed Ibr him by his employee or an independent contractor." Id. at 59.

Having undertaken the treatment of the patient, which including
providing physicians to care for the patient, the hospital was under
a duty to do so effectively and patients entering the hospital
through the emergency department could safely assume that the
treating doctors were acting on behalf of the hospital providing the
care.  It was not incumbent on the patient to he aware of each and
every private contract between the hospital and the physicians. ht.

instruction which stated:

Even if you were to find that Dr. Aparicio was an independent
contractor, the hospital would nevertheless be responsible for any
negligence on his part if Mr. Chmielewski went to the hospital for
hospital treatment and the Defendant hospital undertook to treat
him for a charge and to furnish doctors and staff to render that
treatment. Id. at 878.

provides in relevant part:
. . When a facility undertakes to perform services, he/shefit cannot
transfer  the  obligation  to  perform  those  services  to  an  independent
contractor  and   remains  responsible  for  the  negligence  of  his/her

Teaching Hosp. & Clinic v. Juliana,                                                               863 So. 2d 3-131%.                                                                      1st DCA 20(13). In Juliana. the
court found that the hospital was liable for the negligent acts of a perfusionist after a child
was rushed to the emergency department and needed to have open heart surgery and
suffered an injury during the procedure attributable, at least in part. to the acts of the
perfusionist, lit doing so, the first District Court of Appeal noted:
The duty could not be delegated since the service was contracted
lot. The hospital provided the services of the peratsionist. if the
hospital had wished for the patient to obtain his own perfusionist it
might have been possible to advise the patient that this was his
responsibility.  This certainly was  not done. The fact that the
hospital  chose  to retain  the services of the pethisionist as an
independent contractor rather than an employee is immaterial in
the relationship between the hospital and the patient. Id,
Furthermore. in footnote 9 of its opinion, the First District Court of Appeal again stated
the basic rule on non-delegable duty for physicians at hospitals:
Even                                                                                              ‘v hen a physician is an independent contractor, however,
hospital that "undertake by [express or implied) contract to do for
another a given thing" is not allowed to escape within its contract
liability to the patient by delegating performance under a contract

to an independent contractor                                                               (citing to Irvin  and Chmielewski

negligence of' the Defendant doctors who were caring for the Plaintiffs during the
emergency room admission and subsequent surgeries at SHANDS I IOSPITAL. This case
is strikingly similar the cases of Irving, Chmielewski, and Juliana. The doctors and
medical staff in this case were emergency room physicians and staff, or assigned as a
result of consultation requests from the emergency room.   The Plaintiffs would have
never come into contact with these providers but for the admission to the emergency
room of SHANDS HOSPITAL.

                                                                                           Newbold-Feramson v. AMISUB (North Millie Hospital). Inc.,                                85 So.   3d   502   (Fla. 4th
DCA 2012). Newbold-Ferguson was a wrongful death action alleging negligence on the
part of an emergency room physician, and an attempt to hold a hospital liable for that
physician's negligence. Sec, id. Alter the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the
plaintiff's third amended complaint, the Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the
trial court's ruling. Id. In doing so, it was explained the public policy purpose behind
imposing a non-delegable dot) on hospital emergency situations is that
the imposition of a non-delegable duty to provide competent
emergency  services  makes  sense,  because  a  patient  in  an
emergency generally has little. if any, control over who will be the
treating physician.   This is further evidenced by the Hospital's
vvebsitc where it makes advertisements to the public regarding its
medical services and offers these services to the public upon their
presentation  to  the  Hospital's  facility.  Any  patient  who  then
presents to the Hospital is accepting the Hospital's representations
as true. Id.

were, nor were they privately retained by the Plaintiffs.  Instead. the physicians and staff
rendering care and treatment to VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL. including but not

ELIZABETH VESTAL Special Needs Trust; and VICTORIA VESTAL and EMMANUEL
VESTAL, the natural parents of VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL, a minor, by and through the
undersigned attorney, to respectfully move this Court to grant a 90 extension for service of the
Complaint and Summons, and in support thereof, state as follows:
1. This is a medical malpractice action wherein Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants'
negligent conduct caused severe and permanent injuries to VICTORIA ELIZABETH
VESTAL to include quadriplegia, permanent disability, and permanent reliance on a
ventilator.
2. On December 9, 2015, the Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint and Summons.  As of
the filing of the Motion, service has not yet been effectuated on the Defendants. Service
"2015 CA 004384" 41882859 Filed at Alachua County Clerk 05/24/2016 10:34:52 AM EDT

was not made due to the fact that Plaintiffs were actively engaged in a continuing pre-suit
investigation of claims with regards to other potential Defendants.  Pre-suit has since
expired, and therefore, the Plaintiffs will be seeking to file an Amended Complaint to
incorporate all new potential tortfeasors.
3. Rule 1.070, Florida Rules of Civil Procedure allows the Court, on its own initiate or upon
motion, to set forth additional time for service of process.  Plaintiffs respectfully request
a 90 day extension (on or before August 24, 2016) to effectuate service of process.
4. As this Motion is unopposed, the Plaintiffs have attached a proposed Order for the
Court's consideration.
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request this Honorable Court enter an Order
granting an extension until August 24, 2016 for effectuating service of process.

respectfully request that TODD COPELAND, ESQ., an attorney in good standing with

Pursuant to                                                                                   §766.3025, a Guardian ad Litem must be appointed to review the terms of
any settlement and monetary allocations above $15,000. Pursuant to Rule                       1.210, Fla. R.
Civ. P.: "The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor or incompetent
person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it
deems proper for the protection of the minor or incompetent person."

In Irvino. the Fourth District Court of Appeal
reversed a trial court's jury verdict for failing to instruct a jury on the issue of non-
delegable duty. See id. The Plaintiff in Irving was presented to the emergency department
and the treating physician was not a hospital employee. Id. The Court upheld the non-
delegable duty owed by the hospital for care rendered by an emergency room physician
who was an independent contractor, reasoning:
[the plaintiff]. took ber child to the emergency room of                                       [the
hospital] for treatment. As far as she was concerned, all of the
personnel   furnished  in  the  emergency  room  were  hospital
employees. The hospital held itself out as affording emergency
treatment and the jury could well find that                                                    [the plaintiff] was-
dealing with the hospital. Thus.                                                               11. . .1 the evidence in this case
would justify a jury verdict in [the plaintiffs] favor on the theory
of apparent authority whether                                                                  [the treating physician was.] an
employee or an independent contractor. Failure to so instruct the
jury depri.ved them of the court's advice on. an important aspect of
[the plaintiff s case]. Indeed, that oversight might well account ibr
the adverse verdict.

thrust of [the plaintiff s requested] instruction is that one may not escape his contractual
liability by delegating performance under a contract to an independent contractor. The
contracting party remains liable for the negligent performance of the contract whether it
be performed for him by his employee or an independen contractor.- id, at 59,

a duty to do so effectively and patients entering the hospital

                                                                                                  Teaching Hosp. & Clinic v.

court found that the hospital was liable for the negligent acts of a perfusionist after a child
was rushed to the emergency department and needed to have open heart surgery and
suffered an injury during the procedure attributable, at least in part, to the acts of the
perfusionist. In doing so, the First District Court of Appeal noted:
12

The duty could not be delegated since the service was contracted
for. The hospital provided the services of the perfusionist. If the
hospital had wished for the patient to obtain his own perfusionist it
might have been possible to advise the patient that this was his
responsibility. This certainly was not done. The fact that the
hospital chose to retain the services of the perfusionist as an
independent contractor rather than an employee is immaterial in
the relationship between the hospital and the patient. Id.
66.                                                                                      Furthermore, in footnote 9 of its opinion, the First District Court of Appeal again stated
the basic rule on non-delegable duty for physicians at hospitals:
Even when a physician is an. independent contractor, however,
hospital that "undertake by {express or implied} contract to do tbr
another a given thing" is not allowed to escape within its contract
liability to the patient by delegating performance under a contract
to an independent contractor (citing to Irvin12 and Chmielewski
(internal citations omitted)).
67.                                                                                      In the case at bar, the hospital is attempting to delegate away the liability for the
negligence of the Defendant doctors who were caring for the Plaintiffs during the
emergency room admission and subsequent surgeries at SHANDS HOSPITAL. This case
is strikingly similar the cases of Iryina  Chmielew4i. and Juliana. The doctors and
medical staff in this case were emergency room physicians and staff. or assigned as a
result of consultation requests from the emergency room.  The Plaintiff's would have
never come into contact with these providers but for the admission to the emergency
room of SHANDS HOSPfrAL.
68.                                                                                      This well settled legal concept of non-delegable duty was more recently reaffirmed in
                                                                                         Newbold-Ferguson v.  AMISUB (North  Ridae Hospital), Inc..                                   85 So.   3d 502 (Fla.   4th
DCA 2012). Newbold-Ferguson was a wrongful death action alleging negligence on the
part of an emergency room physician, and an attempt to hold a hospital liable for that
physician's negligence. See  id. After the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the
13

plaintiff's third amended complaint, the Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the
trial court's ruling. Id. In doinf.,, so it was explained the public policy purpose behind.
imposing a non-delegable duty on hospital emergency situations is that:
[Ole imposition of a non-delegable duty to provide competent
emergency  services  makes  sense,  because  a  patient  in  an
emergency generally has little, if any, control over who will be the
treating physician.   This is further evidenced by the Hospital's
website where it makes advertisements to the public regarding its
medical services and offers these services to the public upon their
presentation  to  the Hospital's facility.  Any patient who then
.presents to the Hospital is accepting the Hospital's representations
as true. Id.
69.                                                                                            The Plaintiffs in this ease similarly had no control over who their treating physicians
were, nor were they privately retained by the Plaintiffs.  instead, the physicians and staff
rendering care and treatment to VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL, including but not
limited to Dr. PINCUS, Dr. Mannheimer, Dr. BAINES, DR. BIDARL DR. SHRINER,
Dr. PETERS, DR. STEPHENS,. and RN MEDINA, were provided by, and under the

VIA CERTIFIED MAIL RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED:
CERTIFIED MAIL NO. 7014 2870 0000 1066 4978
Dear Ms. Gallo:
Pursuant to Fla. Stat. 766.106 and Fla. R. Civ. P.                                                            1.650, this letter serves as notice that Emmanuel
Vestal and Victoria Hoyt Vestal, individually and on behalf of Victoria Vestal, a minor, intend to initiate
litigation medical malpractice claims against University of Florida Board of Trustees, Shands Teaching
Hospital and Clinics, Inc. d/b/a Shands Hospital,                                                             its agents,  staff,  nurses,  ARNP's,  residents,  and
physicians including, but not limited to:  David  Pincus, M.D., for   the                                     negligent care and treatment
provided to Victoria Vestal, a minor which ultimately caused her significant permanent injury.
This Notice of Intent is being sent due to your failure to timely produce medical records in a timely
fashion. On May 5, 2015 our office forwarded a request for the following:

•   Complete and entire Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records, notes,
recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and not limited to
those performed on the above minor on                                                                        2/25/2013,                                                                      3/14/2013 and 3/15/2013 to include
but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or video recordings of the
physicians and/or any person involved in the providing of such services.
•   Complete and entire surgical records to include anesthesia records, blood transfusions
requests and records
•   A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives present
during all three procedures described above.  We will need the names of all physicians,

surgeries.  We will need the names of all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP
services provided as well as the name of their employers.
Please  provide the  above  requested  records to us  immediately.                                           We  have  made  numerous
requests, as well as other law firms made and to date our clients have not been provided these records.
Pursuant to Florida law, you have ten (10) days to provide us with the same.  It has been over ten
days and you have ignored our request, therefore your failure to provide us with the complete medical
records Victoria Vestal, minor in a timely manner waives your right of requiring our law firm to attach a
verified affidavit from a medical professional opining to the negligence in this case.
Immediately  upon  receipt of  this  notice  of intent please  forward the  same to your  insurance
carrier and additionally, provide our cffice with complete and legible copies of the following records:
•   Complete and entire Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records,
notes, recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and
not limited to those performed on the above minor on 2/25/2013, 3/14/2013 and
3/15/2013 to include but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or
video recordings of the physicians and/or any person involved in the providing
of such services.
•   Complete  and  entire  surgical  records  to  include  anesthesia  records,  blood
transfusions requests and records
•                                                                                                            A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives
                                                                                                             present during  all three  procedures  described above.                         We will  need  the
names of all physicians, nurses,  PA's, percussionists, assistants and any
person present during the above listed surgeries.  We will need the names of
all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP services provided as well
as the name of their employers
If you, your attorneys or the hospital's professional liability carrier contend or intend to raise as
any  defense  in this case, that this  Notice  of Intent  is defective  in any  manner or  form, we  would
respectfully request that we be informed specifically as to the exact nature of the defect so that we may
cure the same if we deem it appropriate.

Section 766.106 (3)(a) of Florida Statutes, provides no suit shall be filed for a period of 90 days
after notice is served upon perspective defendant.  During this                                               90-day period, you and your insurer are
to conduct a good faith investigation of this claim employing one of the several procedures provided for
in the statute.  I am sure you are aware that any unreasonable failure to comply with the section justifies
the dismissal of defenses in the event a subsequent lawsuit is filed.
In addition to the above, Section 766.106(6), Florida Statutes, provides that:
"Upon receipt by a prospective defendant of a notice of claim, the parties shall make discoverable
information available without formal discovery.  Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal of claims or
defenses ultimately asserted."
Accordingly, I ask that within                                                                                20 days, either you or your representative, respond in writing to
the requests below and forward the following materials:
L                                                                                                             Please state the name, address, occupation and employer of the person or persons investigating
this claim and the  specific  investigative  procedure used to evaluate this claim as specified in
Section 766.1 06(3)(a), Florida Statutes.
2.                                                                                                            Please forward  all  medical  records,  written  notes,  x-rays, bills, photographs and  any other
pertinent documents or reports concerning your treatment of VICTORIA VESTAL, A MINOR.  Please

responsible should you fail to promptly and fully comply with this request.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL - VIA FEDERAL EXPRESS
Dear Ms. Gallo:
Pursuant to Fla. Stat.                                                                                        766.106 and Fla. R. Civ. P.                                               1.650, this letter serves as notice that Emmanuel
Vestal and Victoria Hoyt Vestal, individually and on behalf of Victoria Vestal, a minor, intend to initiate
litigation medical malpractice claims against University of Florida Board of Trustees, Shands Teaching
Hospital and Clinics, Inc. d/b/a Shands Hospital,                                                             its agents,  staff,  nurses,  ARNP's,  residents,  and
physicians including, but not limited to: David  Pincus, M.D., for   the                                      negligent care and treatment
provided to Victoria Vestal, a minor which ultimately caused her significant permanent injury.
This Notice of Intent is being sent due to your failure to timely produce medical records in a timely
fashion. On May 5, 2015 our office forwarded a request for the following:
•   Complete and entire Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records, notes,
recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and not limited to
those performed on the above minor on 2/2.5/2013, 3/14/2013 and 3/15/2013 to include
EXHIBIT

but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or video recordings of the
physicians and/or any person involved in the providing of such services.
•   Complete and entire surgical records to include anesthesia records, blood transfusions
requests and records
•   A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives present
during all three procedures described above.  We will need the names of all physicians,
nurses, PA's, percussionists, assistants and any person present during the above listed
surgeries.  We will need the names of all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP
services provided as well as the name of their employers.
Please provide the above requested records to us immediately.   We have made numerous
requests, as well as other law firms made and to date our clients have not been provided these records.
Pursuant to Florida law, you have ten (10) days to provide us with the same.  It has been over ten
days and you have ignored our request, therefore your failure to provide us with the complete medical
records Victoria Vestal, minor in a timely manner waives your right of requiring our law firm to attach a
verified affidavit from a medical professional opining to the negligence in this case.
Immediately upon receipt of this notice of intent please forward the same to your insurance
carrier and additionally, provide our office with complete and legible copies of the following records:
•   Complete and entire Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records,
notes, recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and
not limited to those performed on the above minor on 2/25/2013, 3/14/2013 and
3/15/2013 to include but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or
video recordings of the physicians and/or any person involved in the providing
of such services.
•   Complete  and  entire  surgical  records  to  include  anesthesia  records,  blood
transfusions requests and records
•   A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives
present during all three procedures described above.   We will  need the
names of all physicians, nurses, PA's, percussionists, assistants and any
person present during the above listed surgeries.  We will need the names of
all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP services provided as well
as the name of their employers
If you, your attorneys or the hospital's professional liability carrier contend or intend to raise as
any  defense in this case, that this Notice of Intent is defective in any manner or form, we would
respectfully request that we be informed specifically as to the exact nature of the defect so that we may
cure the same if we deem it appropriate.
Section 766.106                                                                                               (3)                                       (a) of Florida Statutes, provides no suit shall be filed for a period of   90 days
after notice is served upon perspective defendant.  During this                                               90-day period, you and your insurer are
to conduct a good faith investigation of this claim employing one of the several procedures provided for
in the statute.  I am sure you are aware that any unreasonable failure to comply with the section justifies
the dismissal of defenses in the event a subsequent lawsuit is filed.

In addition to the above, Section 766.106(6), Florida Statutes, provides that:
"Upon receipt by a prospective defendant of a notice of claim, the parties shall make discoverable
information available without formal discovery.  Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal of claims or
defenses ultimately asserted."
Accordingly, I ask that within 20 days, either you or your representative, respond in writing to
the requests below and forward the following materials:
1.                                                                                                        Please state the name, address, occupation and employer of the person or persons investigating
this claim and the specific investigative procedure used to evaluate this claim as specified in
Section 766.106(3)(a), Florida Statutes.

pertinent documents or reports concerning your treatment of VICTORIA VESTAL, A MINOR. Please

MINOR is believed to exist but is not in your possession or control, please describe the document
or report and provide the present location and custodian of the same.

VICTORIA VESTAL, A MINOR and all persons having knowledge of such treatment.  In addition to
their names and present addresses, please briefly indicate each individual's interest in this matter,

Please do  not  respond  by stating:                                                                      "Please  refer to  medical  records" or some  similar
response.   The purpose of this request is to determine if there are any individuals that may have
knowledge or facts that are material to the issue involved in this matter.
5.                                                                                                        Have you ever been  disciplined by any state Board of Medicine where an administrative
complaint was filed against you?  If so, please state the name of the complainant(s), the nature of

the occurrence of  any  of the negligence alleged above, please state each person's name,
address, job title, along with the facts which you base your contention that person was responsible
for.  In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Fabre, it would be prejudicial to my client for you
not to identify any third persons during the pre-suit screening period only to attempt to avoid or
mitigate your liability during subsequent litigation by alleging or arguing that someone other than
yourself  was  wholly  or  partially  responsible.                                                        Please  understand  the  undersigned will take
appropriate action to prevent you from alleging or arguing that someone other than yourself was
responsible should you fail to promptly and fully comply with this request.
7.                                                                                                        Taking into consideration everything you know regarding VICTORIA VESTAL, A MINOR and the

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL
Dear Dr. Pincus:
Pursuant to Fla. Stat. 766.106 and Fla. R. Civ. P.                                                            1.650, this letter serves as notice that Emmanuel

Hospital and Clinics, Inc. d/b/a Shands Hospital,                                                             its agents,  staff,  nurses,  ARNP's,  residents,  and
physicians including,  but not limited to: David Pincus, M.D., for                                            the   negligent care and treatment
provided to Victoria Vestal, a minor which ultimately caused her significant permanent injury.
This Notice of Intent is being sent due to repeated request for medical records from you and your
employer and their failure to timely produce medical records in a timely fashion. On May                      4,                                                                        2015 (see
copy enclosed) our office forwarded a request for the following:
• Complete and entire Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records, notes,
recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and not limited to
those performed on the above minor on 2/25/2013, 3/14/2013 and 3/15/2013 to include
EXHIBIT
1                                                                                                             9

but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or video recordings of the
physicians and/or any person involved in the providing of such services.
•                                                                                                           Complete and entire surgical records to include anesthesia records, blood transfusions
requests and records
•                                                                                                           A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives present
during all three procedures described above.  We will need the names of all physicians,
nurses, PA's, percussionists, assistants and any person present during the above listed
surgeries.  We will need the names of all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP
services provided as well as the name of their employers.
Further, we also forwarded a Notice of Intent on May                                                        13,                                                                                      2015 to Vivian Gallo, the Registered
Agent for the University of Florida.                                                                        (We are enclosing a copy of the same for your review.)  Please
provide the above requested records to us immediately.  We have made numerous requests, as well as
other law firms made and to date our clients have not been provided these records.
Pursuant to Florida law, you have ten (10) days to provide us with the same.  It has been over ten
days and you have ignored our request, therefore your failure to provide us with the complete medical
records Victoria Vestal, minor in a timely manner waives your right of requiring our law firm to attach a
verified affidavit from a medical professional opining to the negligence in this case.
Immediately upon receipt of this notice of intent please forward the same to your insurance
carrier and additionally, provide our office with complete and legible copies of the following records:
•   Complete and entire Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records,
notes, recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and
not limited to those performed on the above minor on 2/25/2013, 3/14/2013 and
3/15/2013 to include but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or
video recordings of the physicians and/or any person involved in the providing
of such services.
•                                                                                                           Complete  and  entire  surgical  records  to  include  anesthesia  records,  blood
transfusions requests and records
•                                                                                                           A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives
present during  all three  procedures described  above.   We will  need the
names of all physicians, nurses, PA's, percussionists, assistants and any
person present during the above listed surgeries.  We will need the names of
all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP services provided as well
as the name of their employers
If you, your attorneys or the hospital's professional liability carrier contend or intend to raise as
any defense in this case, that this Notice of Intent is defective in any manner or form, we would
respectfully request that we be informed specifically as to the exact nature of the defect so that we may
cure the same if we deem it appropriate.
Section 766.106 (3)(a) of Florida Statutes, provides no suit shall be filed for a period of 90 days
after notice is served upon perspective defendant.  During this                                             90-day period, you and your insurer are
to conduct a good faith investigation of this claim employing one of the several procedures provided for

in the statute.  I am sure you are aware that any unreasonable failure to comply with the section justifies
the dismissal of defenses in the event a subsequent lawsuit is filed.
In addition to the above, Section 766.106(6), Florida Statutes, provides that:
"Upon receipt by a prospective defendant of a notice of claim, the parties shall make discoverable
information available without formal discovery.  Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal of claims or
defenses ultimately asserted."
Accordingly, I ask that within                                                                                20 days, either you or your representative, respond in writing to

Dear Ms. Lewis Keith:
Pursuant to Fla. Stat,                                                                                        766.106 and Ha. R. Civ. P.                                                               1.650, this letter serves as notice that Emmanuel
Vestal and Victoria Hoyt Vestal, individually and on behalf of Victoria Vestal, a minor, intend to initiate
litigation medical malpractice claims against University of Florida Board of Trustees, Shands Teaching
Hospital and Clinics, Inc. d/b/a Shands Hospital,                                                             its agents,  staff,  nurses,  ARNP's,  residents,  and
physicians including, but not limited to: David Pincus, M.D., for                                             the   negligent care and treatment
provided to Victoria Vestal, a minor which ultimately caused her significant permanent injury.
This Notice of Intent is being sent due to your failure to timely produce medical records in a timely
fashion. On May 5, 2015 our office forwarded a request for the following:
•                                                                                                             Complete  and  entire  Somatosensory  Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records, notes,
recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and not limited to
those performed on the above minor, on 2                                                                      25 2013, 3/14/2013 and 3/15/2013 to include

but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or video recordings of the
physicians and/or any person involved in the providing of such services.
•                                                                                                             Complete and entire surgical records to include anesthesia records, blood transfusions
requests and records
•   A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives present
during all three procedures described above.  We will need the names of all physicians,
nurses, PA's, percussionists, assistants and any person present during the above listed
surgeries.  We will need the names of all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP
services provided as well as the name of their employers.
Please provide the above requested records to us immediately.   We have made numerous
requests, as well as other law firms made and to date our clients have not been provided these records.
Pursuant to Florida law, you have ten (10) days to provide us with the same. It has been over ten
days and you have ignored our request, therefore your failure to provide us with the complete medical
records Victoria Vestal, minor in a timely manner waives your right of requiring our law firm to attach a
verified affidavit from a medical professional opining to the negligence in this case.
Immediately upon receipt of this notice of intent please forward the same to your insurance
carrier and additionally, provide our office with complete and legible copies of the following records:
•   Complete and entire Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP and SSEP) records,
notes, recordings, and/or monitoring for any and all procedures to include and
not limited to those performed on the above minor on 2/25/2013, 3/14/2013 and
3/15/2013 to include but not limited to the notes, documents and/or audio and/or
video recordings of the physicians and/or any person involved in the providing
of such services.
•   Complete  and  entire  surgical  records  to  include  anesthesia  records,  blood
transfusions requests and records
•   A list of any and all persons to include product manufacturer representatives
present during  all three procedures described above.   We will need the
names of all physicians, nurses, PA's, percussionists, assistants and any
person present during the above listed surgeries.  We will need the names of
all physicians responsible for the SEP and/or SSEP services provided as well
as the name of their employers
If you, your attorneys or the hospital's professional liability carrier contend or intend to raise as
any defense in this case, that this Notice of Intent is defective in any manner or form, we would
respectfully request that we be informed specifically as to the exact nature of the defect so that we may
cure the same if we deem it appropriate.
Section 766.106 (3)(a) of Florida Statutes, provides no suit shall be filed for a period of 90 days
after notice is served upon perspective defendant.  During this 90-day period, you and your insurer are
to conduct a good faith investigation of this claim employing one of the several procedures provided for
in the statute.  I am sure you are aware that any unreasonable failure to comply with the section justifies
the dismissal of defenses in the event a subsequent lawsuit is filed.

In addition to the above, Section 766.106(6), Florida Statutes, provides that:
"Upon receipt by a prospective defendant of a notice of claim, the parties shall make discoverable
information available without formal discovery.  Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal of claims or
defenses ultimately asserted."
Accordingly, I ask that within                                                                            20 days, either you or your representative, respond in writing to
