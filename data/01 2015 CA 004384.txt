2.                                                                                           All statutorily required conditions precedent to the maintenance of this action have been
performed, have occurred, or have been waived.  All requirements of applicable Florida
Statutes have timely been complied with prior to the filing of this action.
3.                                                                                           All statutory conditions precedent to section 768.28, Florida Statutes, have been complied
with, including providing statutory notice of claim.
4.                                                                                           There has been a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are grounds for a
good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care and treatment rendered by the
Defendants in this case, which gives rise to this action.
5.                                                                                           VICTORIA VESTAL and EMMANUEL VESTAL only recently became aware that
there was a reasonable possibility that the injuries sustained by VICTORIA ELIZABETH

VICTORIA VESTAL and EMMANUEL VESTAL became aware of such reasonable
possibility.
6.                                                                                           TODD COPELAND is the Trustee of the VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL Special

ELIZABETH VESTAL, a minor.

FACTS GIVING RISE TO CLAIM
30.                                                                                           On Feburary 22, 2013, VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL (hereafter "VICTORIA"),
then                                                                                          15 months old, was involved in motor vehicle accident.   She was transported to
SHANDS HOSPITAL via ambulance.
31.                                                                                           As part of her work-up in the emergency room, a CT and MRI of the Cervical Spine was
ordered.   The MRI findings were consistent with a three column injury of C 1 -C3,
including injury to  the  posterior atlantoaxial  ligament,  interspinous  ligament,  and
posterior longitudinal ligament injuries at Cl -C2. There was no evidence of a spinal cord
injury on the initial studies.
32.                                                                                           On February 25, 2013, Dr. PINCUS performed surgery on VICTORIA, to include Cl-C3
fixation and Cl-C3 arthodesis.
33.                                                                                           Dr. PINCUS did not enter appropriate post-operative stabilization orders.
34.                                                                                           VICTORIA was discharged on Feburary 27, 2013, and followed-up outpatient with Dr.
PINCUS.
35.                                                                                           During follow-up visits, VICTORIA was able to support he weight, had motor strength
5/5 in all extremities, normal muscle tone in all limbs, and no atrophy.
36.                                                                                           A March 11, 2013 cervical CT revealed increased kyphotic angulation of the cervical
spine. VICTORIA was scheduled for second surgical procedure.
37.                                                                                           On March 14, 2013, Dr. PINCUS performed a C2-3 anterior cervical discectomy and
allograft interbody fusion with anterior plating. The graft selected for implantation was a
7mm pre-drilled allograft.
38.                                                                                           Intraoperative neuromonitoring was utilized during surgery.  Following placement of the
allograft, there was concern regarding potential loss of motor signals.

39.                                                                                         Again, following surgery, Dr. PINCUS did not order appropriate stabilization.
40.                                                                                         Post-operatively, VICTORIA was noted to have diminished neurological status and
functioning.   VICTORIA's extremity strength was markedly deficient, and her motor
responses were unable to be assessed, which indicated neurological dysfunction and
decline.
41.                                                                                         A cervical x-ray at 3:15 p.m. revealed narrowing of the spinal canal by the bone graft.
The study was interpreted by Dr. Shriner and Dr. Bidari.   Despite this finding, no
immediate adjustments were made, and the plan of care was not altered.
42.                                                                                         Following surgery, the child was prematurely extubated which required reintubation and
unnecessary flexing and extending of the neck.
43.                                                                                         Despite knowing that the bone graft was narrowing the spinal canal, an MRI of the spine
was delayed until the next day.
44.                                                                                         Throughout the night, the child continued to show signs of neurological dysfunction and
                                                                                            potential spinal cord injury, to include inability to move extremities.  During this time,
                                                                                            VICTORIA's care was being managed by Dr. Baines and RN Medina.
45.                                                                                         Dr. Baines and RN Medina failed to report the abnormal findings to neurosurgery.
46.                                                                                         An MR1 was performed on March 15, 2013 at 5:10 a.m.  The study was interpreted by
Dr. Stephens and Dr. Peters. The MRI indicated that the bone graft was protruding onto
the spinal cord causing edema, and likely spinal cord damage.                               The interpreting
radiologists failed to directly inform the ordering physician and surgeon of the abnormal
finding.
47.                                                                                         Despite a potentially dangerous spinal cord injury, emergency surgery was delayed over
three hours.

48.                                                                                         During the third surgical procedure, it was confirmed that the bone graft was intruding
and damaging the spinal cord.  Dr. PINCUS had to cut the bone graft in half to prevent
further injury to the spinal cord.
49.                                                                                         Following surgery, VICTORIA was noted to have no movement or sensation.   At
discharge, it was noted that she had no movement or sensation in any of her extremities,
no grimace or response to touch or pinprick, distal rectal tone, no reflexes in any
extremities, and permanent ventilator dependence.
50.                                                                                         As a result of the negligence of the Defendants, VICTORIA is a quadriplegic with
permanent dependence on a ventilator.  VICTORIA has suffered severe and permanent
injuries, which have resulted in her permanent disability.
51.                                                                                         VICTORIA' s injuries were foreseeable, avoidable and preventable.
COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE OF SHANDS HOSPITAL FOR BREACH OF
NON-DELEGABLE DUTY
Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 51 above as though
fully                                                                                       set forth herein and further alleges the following:
52.                                                                                         When a facility, such as SHANDS HOSPITAL, undertakes to perform services, it cannot
transfer the obligation to perform those services to independent contractors, and remains
responsible for the negligence of their contractors.1
53.                                                                                         Generally, if a responsibility is so important to the community, the original party should
not be allowed to transfer it to a third party.2
54.                                                                                         At all times material hereto, the Defendant, SHANDS HOSPITAL, had a non-delegable
duty to provide medical, surgical and nursing care to VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL

in accordance with the general standard of care for providing care and treatment to
pregnant patients.
55.                                                                                               Stated simply, the performance of a duty may be delegated to a third party; however,
liability for the negligent performance of that duty may not be delegated away to a
third party. The policy behind such a rule contemplates that certain duties that are of
utmost importance—namely, the protection of people placed in positions of vulnerability
coupled with a relationship of special trust. In this case, the duty of the hospital to protect
a vulnerable infant during labor, delivery, and post-delivery.
56.                                                                                               Under the law defining a non-delegable duty, a party who has an obligation to perform
acts or who has undertaken certain duties has the obligation to perform those acts and
duties in a non-negligent fashion,  If the party chooses to delegate those acts to a third
party—i.e.,  an  independent  contractor—the  original  party  remains  liable  for  any
negligence of that third party—regardless of whether the negligent act was performed by
an agent or independent contractor.   See generally Newbold-Ferguson v. AMISUB
(North Ridge Hosp.), Inc., 85 So. 3d 502 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012); Shands Teaching Hosp. &
Clinic, Inc. v. Juliana, 863 So. 2d 343, 349 (Fla.                                                1st DCA 2003); Irving v. Doctor's Hosp.
of Lake Worth, Inc., 415 So.2d 55 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982) (holding that where the physician
is not privately retained by the patient and his activities are controlled by the hospital,
courts have held hospitals liable under theories of non-delegable duty).
57.                                                                                                                                                                                                 The seminal case on non-delegable duty is Irving v. Doctor's Hosp. of Lake Worth, Inc.,
                                                                                                  415 So.                                                                                 2d   55   (Fla.                                                                                     4th DCA 1982). In Irving, the Fourth District Court of Appeal
reversed a trial court's jury verdict for failing to instruct a jury on the issue of non-
delegable duty. See id. The Plaintiff in Irving was presented to the emergency department
9

and the treating physician was not a hospital employee. Id. The Court upheld the non-
delegable duty owed by the hospital for care rendered by an emergency room physician
who was an independent contractor, reasoning:
[the plaintiff] took her child to the emergency room of                                        [the
hospital] for treatment. As far as she was concerned, all of the
personnel  furnished  in  the  emergency  room  were  hospital
employees. The hospital held itself out as affording emergency
treatment and the jury could well find that                                                    [the plaintiff] was
dealing with the hospital. Thus,                                                               [. . .] the evidence in this case
would justify a jury verdict in [the plaintiff's] favor on the theory
of apparent authority whether                                                                  [the treating physician was]  an
employee or an independent contractor. Failure to so instruct the
jury deprived them of the court's advice on an important aspect of
[the plaintiff's case]. Indeed, that oversight might well account for
the adverse verdict.
58.                                                                                            The court then focused on the jury instructions given by the Trial Court noting "[t]he
thrust of [the plaintiff's requested] instruction is that one may not escape his contractual
liability by delegating performance under a contract to an independent contractor. The
contracting party remains liable for the negligent performance of the contract whether it
be performed for him by his employee or an independent contractor." Id. at 59.
59.                                                                                            Following this logic, the Irving Court pointed out in footnote [2]:
Having undertaken the treatment of the patient, which including
providing physicians to care for the patient, the hospital was under
a duty to do so effectively and patients entering the hospital
through the emergency department could safely assume that the
treating doctors were acting on behalf of the hospital providing the
care.  It was not incumbent on the patient to be aware of each and
every private contract between the hospital and the physicians. Id.
at 60-61.
60.                                                                                            The physicians and staff rendering care to VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL at
SHANDS HOSPITAL, including but not limited to Dr. PINCUS, Dr. Mannheimer, Dr.
Baines, Dr. Bidari, Dr. Shriner, Dr. Peters, Dr. Stephens, and RN Medina, were not
privately retained by VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL or her parents, and their

activities were controlled by SHANDS HOSPITAL.  See Irving v. Doctor's Hospital of

and treatment to VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL were anything other than medical
providers  assigned  to  them  by  SHANDS  HOSPITAL.  As  in  Irving,  where  the
independent contractor status of the physician was not a defense available to the hospital,
so too is the defense not available to the Defendants in this case.
62.                                                                                                                    After the Irving decision, the Fifth District Court of Appeal addressed the issues arising
out of claims non-delegable duty in Orlando Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Chmielewski, 573 So. 2d
876 (Fla.                                                                                                              5th DCA 1990), abrogated on other grounds, Boulis v. Fla. Dept of Transp.,
733 So.2d 959                                                                                                          (Fla.                                                                                          1999). In Chmielewski, the facts revealed a patient entered the
emergency room of a local hospital to receive treatment, and as a result of the treatment
which alleged to have been negligent was injured. Id. at 878.
63.                                                                                                                    The Fifth District Court ruled that the trial court committed no error, noting that the jury
instruction given in Chmielewski was "essentially a correct statement of the law." Id.
That jury instruction, which began with [then] Florida Standard Jury Instruction 3.3b(2)
followed by the bracketed independent contractor instruction of 3.3b(1), also included an
instruction which stated:
3 Holding that where the physician is not privately retained by the patient and his activities are controlled by the
hospital, courts have held hospitals liable under theories of non-delegable duty.)
11

Even if you were to find that Dr. Aparicio was an independent
contractor, the hospital would nevertheless be responsible for any
negligence on his part if Mr. Chmielewski went to the hospital for
hospital treatment and the Defendant hospital undertook to treat
him for a charge and to furnish doctors and staff to render that
treatment. Id. at 878.
64.                                                                                               The Florida Standard Jury Instruction regarding non-delegable duties for treatment
provides in relevant part:
. . . When a facility undertakes to perform services, he/she/it cannot
transfer the obligation to perform those services to an independent
contractor  and  remains  responsible  for  the  negligence  of  his/her
independent contractor. See Florida Standard Jury Instruction 402.9(a)(1).
65.                                                                                               After the Chmielewski opinion, the First District Court of Appeal decided Shands
Teaching Hosp. & Clinic v. Juliana,                                                               863 So. 2d 343(Fla.                                                                          1st DCA 2003). In Juliana, the
court found that the hospital was liable for the negligent acts of a perfusionist after a child
was rushed to the emergency department and needed to have open heart surgery and
suffered an injury during the procedure attributable, at least in part, to the acts of the
perfusionist. In doing so, the First District Court of Appeal noted:
The duty could not be delegated since the service was contracted
for. The hospital provided the services of the perfusionist. If the
hospital had wished for the patient to obtain his own perfusionist it
might have been possible to advise the patient that this was his
responsibility.  This certainly was not done. The fact that the
hospital chose to retain the services of the perfusionist as an
independent contractor rather than an employee is immaterial in
the relationship between the hospital and the patient. Id.
66.                                                                                               Furthermore, in footnote 9 of its opinion, the First District Court of Appeal again stated
the basic rule on non-delegable duty for physicians at hospitals:
Even when a physician is an independent contractor, however,
hospital that "undertake by [express or implied] contract to do for
another a given thing" is not allowed to escape within its contract
liability to the patient by delegating performance under a contract
12

to an independent contractor                                                               (citing to Irving and Chmielewski
(internal citations omitted)).
67.                                                                                        In the case at bar, the hospital is attempting to delegate away the liability for the
negligence of the Defendant doctors who were caring for the Plaintiffs during the
emergency room admission and subsequent surgeries at SHANDS HOSPITAL. This case
is strikingly similar the cases of Irving, Chmielewski. and Juliana. The doctors and
medical staff in this case were emergency room physicians and staff, or assigned as a
result of consultation requests from the emergency room.   The Plaintiffs would have
never come into contact with these providers but for the admission to the emergency
room of SHANDS HOSPITAL.
68.                                                                                        This well settled legal concept of non-delegable duty was more recently reaffirmed in
                                                                                           Newbold-Ferguson v. AMISUB (North Ridge Hospital), Inc., 85 So.                         3d 502 (Fla.   4th
DCA 2012). Newbold-Ferguson was a wrongful death action alleging negligence on the
part of an emergency room physician, and an attempt to hold a hospital liable for that
physician's negligence. See id. After the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the
plaintiff's third amended complaint, the Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the
trial court's ruling. Id. In doing so, it was explained the public policy purpose behind
imposing a non-delegable duty on hospital emergency situations is that:
[t]he imposition of a non-delegable duty to provide competent
emergency  services  makes  sense,  because  a  patient  in  an
emergency generally has little, if any, control over who will be the
treating physician.   This is further evidenced by the Hospital's
website where it makes advertisements to the public regarding its
medical services and offers these services to the public upon their
presentation to the Hospital's facility. Any patient who then
presents to the Hospital is accepting the Hospital's representations
as true. Id.

69.                                                                                           The Plaintiffs in this case similarly had no control over who their treating physicians
were, nor were they privately retained by the Plaintiffs. Instead, the physicians and staff
rendering care and treatment to VICTORIA ELIZABETH VESTAL, including but not
limited to Dr. PINCUS, Dr. Mannheimer, Dr. Baines, Dr. Bidari, Dr. Shriner, Dr. Peters,
Dr. Stephens, and RN Medina, were provided by, and under the control of, SHANDS
HOSPITAL, thus creating a non-delegable duty.
70.                                                                                           This non-delegable duty was breached by SHANDS HOSPITAL in the following ways:
a.                                                                                            Through the negligence of their employees, staff, resident physicians, agents,
and/or  apparent  agents  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Dr.  PINCUS,  Dr.
Mannheimer, Dr. Baines, Dr. Bidari, Dr. Shriner, Dr. Peters, Dr. Stephens, and
RN Medina, as these providers breached their duty of care owed to VICTORIA
ELIZABETH VESTAL, as follows:
(1)                                                                                           Failing to provide timely and appropriate care and treatment;
