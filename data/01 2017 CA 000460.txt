breach of their constitutional and statutory duty to permit access to public records, compelling

7.  As an employee of the University of Florida, KEITH is subject to the

8.  JOHNSON is a "person" as that term is used in the Public Records Act. S 19.07(1)(a),

Florida Statutes, Section                                                                             119.01                                                                                (12)                                                            (2016). See also Shevin v Byron, Harless, Schaffer,
Reid and Associates, Inc, 379 So. 2d 633, 640 (Ha.                                                    1980).  See also Wait v Florida
Power & Light Company, 372, So.2d 420 (Fla. 1979); Art. I, s 24, Fla. Const.
11. Thus, information stored in a public agency's computer is as much a public records as
a written page in a book or a tabulation in a file stored in a filing cabinet. See Seigle v. Barry,
422 So. 2d 63, 65 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982) National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Associated
Press,                                                                                                1 So.3d 1201 (Fla. 1 st DCA 2009) and AG 98-54, AGO 1-61 and AG 85-03. Accordingly,
electronic public records are governed by the same rule as written documents and such electronic
records are subject to public inspection.
12. The fact that the records are part of a preliminary process does not remove them from
the definition of a "public record." When material falls within the statutory definition of "public
record" in Chapter                                                                                    119.011                                                                               (12), Florida Statutes, and has been prepared to "perpetuate,
communicate or formalize knowledge, the record is subject to disclosure even if the agency
believes that release of the non-final product could be detrimental.   See e.g.,  Gannett
Corporation Inc. v Goldtrap,                                                                          302 So.2d                                                                             174                                                             (Fla.                                                 2d DCA 1974) (county's concern that
premature disclosure of a report could be harmful to the county does not make the document
confidential. Grapski v. City ofA lachua, 31 So. 3d 193 (Fla 1st DCA 2010).
13. Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes implements a right guaranteed to members of the
public under the Florida Constitution and it, therefore, promotes "a state interest of the highest
order." See NCAA v. Associated Press, 18 So.3d 1201, 1212 (1                                          St DCA 2009).
14. The right of access to public records applies to "any public body, officer or employee
of the state or persons acting on their behalf..." Art I s 24, Fla Const; see also s 119.011(2).
15. The constitutional right of public access to governmental records must be interpreted
3

"liberally in favor of openness and any exemptions from disclosure are construed narrowly and
limited to their designated purpose." See Ramese, Inc. v Demings, 29 So.3d 418, 421 (5`h DCA
2010).
16. Under Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes, a state agency has a duty to permit the
inspection, copying, and photography of the public records by any person desiring to do so, at a
reasonable time, under reasonable conditions, and for reasonable costs. (emphasis added) See s.
110.07 Stat; Art I, s 24, Fla. Const.
17. FLORIDA, as an agency and custodian of records, has an obligation to provide any
non-exempt public  records  for  inspection, copying and photography  upon request.  See
119.07                                                                                             (1)   (a), Fla. Stat. Art. I s 24 Fla Const.
18. The public records requests that are the subject of this lawsuit were all made in
Alachua County, Florida to the University of Florida, located in Alachua County Florida.
19. The responses to the public records requests that are the subject of this lawsuit should
be provided in Alachua County, Florida.
20. JOHNSON has retained the law office of Robert A. Rush, P.A. to represent him in

Your Duty to Prevent Spoliation, Modification or Destruction of Materials
We hereby put you on notice that you have a duty to prevent spoliation, modification or
destruction of any aspect of any materials that have so been requested.
We would prefer to avoid any litigation that may result from your non-compliance with the
above-listed records requests, and any future records requests that may be made.
In an abundance of caution and to fully apprise you of your duty to avoid spoliation,

modification and  or the destruction of materials requested, please consider following the
instructions listed below:
You should anticipate that much of the information that has been, or may be, requested is stored
on your computer systems and other media and devices (including but not limited to personal
digital assistants, voice-messaging systems, online repositories, personal tablets and cell phones).
Electronically stored information (hereinafter "ESI") should be afforded the broadest possible
meaning and includes, by way of example and not as an exclusive list, potentially relevant
information electronically, magnetically, optically, or otherwise stored as:
Digital communications (i.e., email, voice mail, instant messaging, text messaging,
iMessaging);
Email server stores (e.g., Lotus Domino .NSF or Microsoft Exchange .EDB;
Word processed documents (e.g., Word or WordPerfect files and drafts);
Spreadsheets and tables (e.g., Excel or Lotus 123 worksheets);
Accounting Application Data (e.g., Quickbooks, Money, Peachtree data);
Image and Facsimile File (e.g., .PDF, .TIFF. .JPEG, .GIF images);
Sounds Recordings (e.g., .WAV and .MP3 files);
Video and Animation (e.g., .AVI and .MOV files);
Databases (e.g., Access, Oracle, SQL Server Data, SAP);
Contact and Relationship Management Data (e.g., Outlook, ATC!);
Calendar and Diary Application Data (e.g., Outlook PST, blog entries);
Online Access Data (e.g., Temporary Internet Files, History, Cookies);
Presentations (e.g., PowerPoint, Corel Presentations);
Network Access and Server Activity Logs;
Project Management Application Data;
Computer Aided Design/Drawing Files; and
Backup and Archival Files (e.g., Veritas, Zip, .GHO)
ESI resides not only in areas of electronic, magnetic, and optical storage media reasonably
accessible to you, but also in areas you may deem not reasonably accessible. You are obliged to
preserve potentially relevant evidence from both sources of ESI, even if you do not anticipate
producing such ESI.
The request that you preserve both accessible and inaccessible ESI is reasonable and necessary.
You should identify all sources of ESI you decline to preserve and, if requested, any you find are
not subject to production and why. Your preservation of such materials is necessary and
required at this time.
You should note that preservation requires immediate intervention on your behalf. Given our
current inquiry into the potential ethical and financial malfeasance in the Office of General
Counsel at the University of Florida. Preservation of materials at current time should include
anything related to your application to the University of Florida up to and through the present
time (i.e., the months leading up to August 2006 to present).
Adequate preservation of ESI requires more than simply refraining from efforts to destroy or
Page 3 of 7

dispose of such evidence.  You must intervene to prevent loss due to routine operations or
malfeasance and employ proper techniques and protocols to preserve ESL Booting a drive,
examine its contents, or running any application may irretrievably alter the ESI it contains and
constitute unlawful spoliation of evidence. A such, preservation of potentially relevant
information requires your immediate attention and action.
Nothing in this request for preservation of ESI should be understood to diminish your concurrent
obligation to preserve documents, tangible things, and other potentially relevant materials to the
current inquiry. Moreover, this request to preserve information subject to the records requests is
both retroactive and prospective in application, which means that it extends to all documents,
tangible things, and electronically stored information that currently exist relating to this inquiry,
as well as all documents, tangible things, and electronically stored information that are created in
the future during the court of this inquiry.
You are requested to immediately initiate a "litigation hold"' for potentially relevant ESI,
documents, and tangible things and to act diligently and in good faith to secure and audit
compliance with such litigation hold.  You are further requested to immediately identify and
modify or suspend features of your information systems and devices that, in routine operation,
order to cause the loss of potentially relevant ESL Examples of such features and operations
include (but are not limited to):
Purging the contents of email repositories by age capacity, or other criteria;
Using data or media wiping, disposal, erasure, or encryption utilities or devices;
Overwriting, erasing, destroying, or discarding backup media;
Re-assigning, re-imaging, or disposing of systems, servers, devices, or media;
Running antivirus or other programs effecting wholesale metadata alteration;
Releasing or purging online storage repositories;
Using metadata stripper utilities;
Disabling server, packet, or local instant messaging logging; and,
Executing drive or file defragmentation or compression programs.
You should anticipate that persons in your office, including yourself, may seek to hide, destroy
or alter ESI and other documents and tangible items. Especially where company machines were
used for interne access or personal communications, you should anticipate that users may seek
to delete or destroy potentially relevant ESI. These activities are not unique to you. This is
simply conduct that occurs with such regularity that any custodian of ESI and their counsel must
anticipate its occurrence. You should act to prevent and guard against such actions.
You should take affirmative steps to prevent anyone with access to your data, systems, and
archives from seeking to modify, destroy, or hide ESI on network or local hard drives and on
other media or devices (such as deleting or overwriting files; using data shredding and
I While we are not engaged in litigation at this time, the same theory of "litigation hold" should
apply to the records requests.  Undersigned Counsel requests that you consider the materials
discussed herein, and in all public records requests made by our office, both retroactively and
prospectively, as materials subject to the records requests.

overwriting applications; defragmentation, re-imaging, damaging, or replacing media;
encryption; or compression).
You are requested to preserve complete backup tape sets (including differentials and
incrementals) containing ESI related to this action.
To limit the threat of spoliation and data loss, we request that you employ forensically sound ESI
preservation methods to create an image of the systems, media, and devices of any person that
has or had the ability to create, read, update, or delete ESI relevant to this matter. Forensically
sounds ESI preservation means duplication of all stored on the evidence media while employing
a proper chain of custody and using tools and methods that make no changes to the evidence and
support authentication of the duplicate as a true and complete bit-for-bit image of the original. A
forensically sound preservation method guards against changes to metadata evidence and
preserves all parts of the electronic evidence, including deleted evidence within "unallocated
clusters" and "slack space."
Be advised that a conventional copy, backup, or "Ghosting" of a hard drive does not produce a
forensically sound image because it only captures active, unlocked data files and fails to preserve
other forensically significant data (e.g., data existing in unallocated clusters and slack space).
You should anticipate that ESI will be sought in the form of forms in which it is ordinarily
maintained (i.e., native forms). The forensically sound image described above will preserve ESI
in such native form. You should not employ methods to preserve ESI that remove or degrade the
ability to search the ESI by electronic means or that make it difficult or burdensome to access or
use the information. You should additionally refrain from actions that shift ESI from reasonably
accessible media and forms to less accessible media and forms if the effect of such actions is to
make such ESI not reasonably accessible.
You should further anticipate the need to disclose and produce system and application metadata
and act to preserve it.  System metadata is information describing the history and characteristics
of other ESL The information is typically associated with tracking or managing an electronic file
and often includes data reflecting a file's name, size, custodian, location and dates of creation
and last modification or access. Application metadata is information automatically included or
embedded in electronic files, but which may not be apparent to a user, including deleted content,
draft language, commentary, collaboration and distribution data and dates of creating and
printing. For electronic mail, metadata includes all header routing data and Base 64 encoded
attachment data, in addition to the To, From, Subject, Received Data, CC and BCC fields.
Metadata may be overwritten or corrupted by careless handling or improper preservation,
including by moving, copying or examination the contents of files. We would suggest that you
consider following the principles of preservation of ESI as set forth in The Sedona Principles,
(the annotated version) 2007 BNA Books. See, e.g. Order of the Honorable David Baker,
Magistrate Judge and the Honorable Anne Conway for the Middle District of Florida Case
No 6:06-md-1769-0r1-22DAB and MDL Docket # 1769, 2007 WL 219989 (M.D. Fla.
January 26, 2007), 56, 119, 187, and 197; IN RE: Seroquel Products Liability Litigation.
With respect to servers used to manage email (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino) and
Page 5 of 7

network storage (often called a "network share"), the complete contents of each user's network
share and email account should be preserved if that user has potential relevance to this matter.
There are several way to preserve the contents of a server. If you are uncertain whether the
preservation method you plan to employ is on that we will accept as sufficient, please
immediately contact the undersigned.
Though we expect that you will act swiftly to preserve data on office workstations and servers,
you should also determine if any home or portable systems or devices may contain potentially
relevant data. To the extent that you have sent or received potentially relevant emails or created
or reviewed potentially relevant documents away from the office, you must preserve the contents
of systems, devices and media used for these purposes (including not only potentially relevant
data from portable and home computers, but also from portable thumb drives, CDR/DVD-R
disks, and the user's PDA, smart phone, voice mailbox, or other forms of ESI storage).
Similarly, if you used online or browser-based email account or services (such as attachments,
the contents of these account mailboxes (including Sent, Deleted, and Archived Message folders)
should be preserved.
You should preserve documents and other tangible items that may be required to access, interpret
or search potentially relevant ESI, including but not limited to logs, control sheets,
specifications, indices, naming protocols, file lists, network diagrams, flow charts, instruction
sheets, data entry forms, abbreviation keys, and user ID and password rosters. You should
preserve passwords, keys, and other authenticators required to access encrypted files or run
applications, along with the installation disks, user manuals, and license keys for applications
required to access the ESI. You should preserve cabling, drivers, and hardware, other than a
standard 3.5" floppy disk drive or standard CD or DVD optical disk drive, if needed to access or
interpret media on which ESI is stored. This includes tape drives, bar code readers, Zip drives,
and other legacy or proprietary devices.
As hard copies do not preserve electronic search-ability or metadata, they are not an adequate
substitute for, or cumulative of, electronically stored versions. If information exists in both
electronic and paper forms, you should preserve both.
Your preservation obligation extends beyond ESI in you care, possession or custody and includes
ESI in the custody of others that is subject to your direction or control. Accordingly, you should
notify any current or former agent, attorney, employee, custodian, and contractor in possession
of potentially relevant ESI to preserve such ESI to the full extent of your obligation to do so, and
you should take reasonable steps to secure their compliance. This would include contractors or
"consultants" such as Herschel Khan and I or his company HK Enterprises.
We are desirous of working with you to agree upon an acceptable protocol for forensically sound
preservation and can supply a suitable protocol if you will furnish an inventory and deception of
the systems and media to be preserved. Alternatively, if you promptly disclose the preservation
protocol you intend to employ along with an inventory and description of the systems and media
to be preserved, we can identify and points of disagreement and resolve them.
You should not defer preservation steps pending any discussions if ESI may be lost or corrupted

as a consequence of delay. Should your failure to preserve potentially relevant materials result in
the corruption, loss, or delay in production of the materials which we have requested (and may
request in the future), such failure could constitute spoliation of materials (and evidence), and we
will not hesitate to seek the appropriate remedy.
To ensure that appropriate preservation measures are implemented, we request that a copy of this
letter with specific instructions from you be promptly provided to each employee, agent,
attorney, consultant, or representative who may have relevant materials and that each recipient
acknowledge receipt and understanding of your instructions. We specifically request that it
given to attorney Keith. Please confirm by February 1, 2017 that you have taken the steps
outlined in this letter to preserve ESI and tangible documents potentially relevant to this action.
If you have not undertaken the steps outlined above, or have taken other actions, please describe
what you have done to preserve potentially relevant evidence.
With Assurances,
Os  ryo
