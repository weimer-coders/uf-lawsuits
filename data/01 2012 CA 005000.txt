Defendant UFBOT's medical school faculty, attending physicians, residents, and
interns under its supervision are required to and do provide medical care and treatment to
patients such as Susan Adamec who are admitted to Defendant Shands for medical care and
treatment.  Defendant UFBOT provides supervision, protocol, policies and procedures with respect
to the medical care that is provided to patients such as Mrs. Adamec who was a private patient at
Defendant Shands where she received all of her medical care and treatment.
5.                                                                                                  Defendant Shands owns, operates, and maintains a private hospital which provides
medical care and treatment to patients such as Mrs. Adamec.  Patient care is provided through
doctors who treat the patients admitted by Shands at Defendant Shands.  Defendant Shands is a
private entity.  When it provides medical care and treatment to patients such as Mrs. Adamec,
even if some of the physicians providing care at Defendant Shands may have some connection
with Defendant UFBOT, Defendant Shands, as a private entity, treating a private patient, is not
subject to the benefit of Fla. Stat.                                                                768.28, a protection afforded solely to Defendant UFBOT,
which is a public entity.

incidental to their duties as health care providers, or alternatively, were performing medical care

Defendant Shands, that of providing their healthcare services at Defendant Shands, which
undertook to provide such services, as a full service acute care hospital to patients such as Susan
Adamec, who came there for treatment. Defendant Shands exercised control over the working
hours, payment, quality of medical care and scheduling of the provision of such services by Dr.
White and Nurse Ford, who accepted and acknowledged the agency relationship between them.

employees of Defendant Shands which is responsible for the negligence of Dr. White and Nurse
Ford, even if Defendant Shands had no actual control or right of control.  Defendant Shands is
responsible for the negligence of Dr. White and Nurse Ford as its apparent agents or employees
because Dr. White and Nurse Ford were acting within the scope of their apparent authority at the
time and place of the incident complained of.   Defendant Shands, by its words or conduct,
represented, caused, or allowed the Plaintiffs to believe that Dr. White and Nurse Ford were
agents of the Defendant Shands and had authority to act for Defendant Shands.  Susan Adamec
justifiably relied upon the belief that in dealing with Dr. White and Nurse Ford that they were
agents of Defendant Shands and that Defendant Shands would be responsible for the negligence
of Dr. White and Nurse Ford and which negligence occurred while they were acting within the
scope of their apparent authority to provide medical care and services on behalf of Defendant
Shands.  Defendants Shands, Dr. White, and Nurse Ford accepted and acknowledged the agency
relationship between them.

nondelegable  duty  which  it  undertook  when  it  agreed  to  provide  anesthesiologists  and
anesthetists with respect to the delivery of anesthesiology services to Susan Adamec.  Dr. White
and Nurse Ford also agreed to undertake and provide such services.  Because of this undertaking
by Defendant Shands, a  nondelegable duty arose and was undertaken by Shands through
Defendant Dr. White and Nurse Ford to provide treatment. Therefore, Defendant Shands had the
nondelegable duty to provide such care and services to Susan Adamec.  Defendants Dr. White
and  Nurse Ford will be deemed to be the agents of Defendant Shands on account of its
nondelegable duty to provide such services.   Alternatively, Defendant Shands had a direct
nondelegable duty to Mrs. Adamec on account of its admitting her for treatment and services at
its hospital.

August                                                                                             10,                                                                                2010.   Her diagnosis was lumbar strain, muscle spasm or potentially a Lupus flair.
She was prescribed Flexeril, and referred to Rheumatology. She was discharged home.

back pain.  She was admitted to Shands on August 17, 2010. On admission it was noted that she
had a history of scoliosis, chronic lower back pain, past DVT and three weeks of worsening of
lower back pain.   She had a tingling of her toes.   Rheumatology noted that there was an L2
fracture and raised the question of metastatic disease versus infection. Mrs. Adamec was seen by
the neurosurgical service which determined that she was stable.                                    Neurological service also

determined that Mrs. Adamec did not require intervention at that time.  They would continue to
follow her. A CT was pending. There was a question as to multiple myeloma based on the MRI.

deformity of L2.   There were abnormal marrow signals with the consideration of metastasis,
myeloma, or a hepatic malignancy.  Skeletal survey showed no destructive lytic or blastic lesions.
Her lungs showed an inflammatory process and possible carcinoma.  A 1.6 x 1.3 lesion abutting
the pleura in the right lung base was found.
16.                                                                                                       On August 20, 2010, a CT guided biopsy was performed of the L2 vertebrae. This
study revealed a pathology of AFB, Mycobacterium Kansasii. These were outpatient studies.  Mrs.
Adamec was then admitted to the hospital on September 22, 2010 through December 10,                       2010
for management of the osteomyelitis/infection which was now the working diagnosis.   The
infection was in her vertebrae.  The records indicate that this process was an acid fast bacillus
(AFC) that was due to a TB infection.
17.                                                                                                       Mrs.  Adamec was placed on  multiple  medications  including  Norvasc, Aspirin,

Pyrazinamide,  Rifampin, Cepacol,  Benadryl,  Lidocaine for a sore throat,  Maalox, Zofran and
Oxycodone.

to track and follow the osteomyelitis.  Through the procedure, the records indicated that Mrs.
Adamec could not lie flat as needed for the MRI.   The plan was to put her under general
anesthesia.

after the code by Nurse Ford indicated that Mrs. Adamec had arrived in MRI that morning.  She
had excruciating back pain and was in great distress.  She could not lie flat.  Mrs. Adamec was
allergic to multiple pain medications including Morphine, Oxycodone, Percocet and Tramadol.
The drugs that were used to treat her were back pain limited.

to the history of frank reflux and severe regurgitation.

Mrs. Adamec received Lidocaine                                                   100 then Propofol                                                                               200 mg. and ETT placed.
Because Mrs. Adamec was still moving, another 100 mg. of Propofol was given at 10:30 a.m.  Her
vital signs were stable with a BP of 110/40, HR 120.  Mrs. Adamec was maintained on Isoflurane
anesthesia.                                                                                        She was moving despite the amounts of Isoflurane that caused some reactive
hypotension with a systolic BP of 90 therefore, Mrs. Adamec was paralyzed with Pancuronium.

blood pressure.  Otherwise Mrs. Adamec did well throughout the lengthy MRI scan.  The scan
was completed at 1330 hours.  Anesthesia was discontinued.  Mrs. Adamec was transported from
the MRI scanner to the recovery area a few feet away on the MRI monitor.  On transfer from the
MRI stretcher and the MRI monitor to the recovery stretcher and monitor,  her heart rate
decreased.  Mrs. Adamec went asystolic.

etiology of the asystolic arrest was unclear.   This was apparently discussed with attending
physician Dr. Pauly as well as the MICU resident.

brain activity.  It was noted that Mrs. Adamec had a PEA arrest that was attributed to circulatory
collapse secondary to Propofol.
