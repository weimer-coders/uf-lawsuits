withheld certain scientific documentation and other public records from review by
Plaintiff. Defendant maintains an Extension Education Program in Broward County in
Urban   Horticulture (UF-IFAS). Whereas   the, ""UF-IFAS/Broward   County   Urban
Horticulture formulates implementation policy for the OF IFAS Florida Yards and
Neighborhood residential and commercial developments in Broward County."" The Defendant maintains a University campus and academic degree programs in Environmental  Horticulture,  Plant  Pathology,  and  Turfgrass  Science  in Davie, Broward County, Florida at Ft. Lauderdale Research and Education Center 3205 College Ave., Davie, FL 33314-7799. Defendant's employee and co-author of the publications at issue in this case,
John L. Cisar, Professor, Turfgrass and Water management maintains his principal place
of business in Davie, Broward County, Florida at the University Campus located at 3205
College Ave., Davie, FL 33314-7799. Venue properly lies in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, Florida, pursuant to Section 47.011, Florida Statutes, whereas both parties are corporate entities maintaining places of business located in the aforesaid county. Parties Plaintiff, the SIERRA CLUB, INC., is a Florida not-for-profit corporation which promotes awareness and environmental preservation.  Sierra Club's mission is to explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth and to educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment.
Defendant, the UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, is a Florida public university, created and authorized pursuant to the laws of the State of Florida and is subject to the
provisions of the Government in the Sunshine and Public Records Laws. Article I, Section 24(a) Florida's Constitution states in pertinent part: ""Every person has a right to inspect or copy any public record made or
received in connection with the official business of any public body,
officer, or employee of the state, or persons acting on their behalf, except
with respect to records exempted pursuant to this section or specifically
made confidential by this Constitution. This section specifically includes
the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government and each
agency or department created thereunder; counties, municipalities, and
districts; and each constitutional officer, board, and commission, or entity
created pursuant to law or this constitution."" Inspection and copying of records; photographing public records; fees; exemptions states in its pertinent parts:
Fla. Stat. §119.07(1)(a) Every person who has custody of a public record
shall permit the record to be inspected and copied by any person desiring to do so, at any
reasonable time under reasonable conditions, and under supervision by the custodian of
the records. A person who has custody of a public record who asserts that an exemption applies to a part of such record shall redact that portion of the record to which an exemption has been asserted and validly applies, and such person shall produce the remainder of such record for inspection and copying. If the person who has custody of a public record contends that all or part of the record is exempt from inspection and copying, he or she shall state the basis of the exemption that he or she contends is applicable to the record, including statutory citation to an exemption created or afforded by statute. If requested by the person seeking to inspect or copy the record, the custodian of records shall state in writing and with particularity the
reasons for the conclusion that the record is exempt or confidential.
The University is a public body under the Government in the Sunshine Law.
Public bodies such as the University cannot maintain public records in confidentiality out
of the public eye, except in very limited and narrow circumstances.  Wood v. Marston,
442 So. 2d 934 (Fla. 1983). The University's  Institute  of Food  and Agricultural  Sciences originally published SL 283, Unintended Consequences Associated with Certain Urban Fertilizer Ordinances and ENH 1115, Frequently Asked Questions about Landscape
Fertilization  for Florida-Friendly  Landscaping  Ordinances  in March 2009. Such
publications  identified new fertilization  standards  and promoted revision of local
ordinances with regard to nitrogen and phosphorous. Such publications have been and are currently relied on by government agencies throughout the state. Following a series of electronic mail correspondence between Sierra Club and the University, Sierra Club, via Regional Representative Cris Costello, submitted a public records request, July 29, 2010 to the University, via employees or agents Terril A. Neil and Jack M. Payne. The public record request stated in its pertinent part ""I hereby submit a public records request for the names, titles, and contact information and their respective reviews made prior to publication for SL 283 and ENH 1115."" (Attachment A). The public records request went unanswered and on August 13, 2010 was resubmitted by Sierra Club, via Regional Representative Cris Costello to the University, via employee or agent Janine Sikes. (Attachment B). The request stated: I hereby request the ""science upon which"" the urban ""fertilizer management recommendations"" in the ""state model ordinance"" are based; this includes: A. The scientific literature that suggests a 3-foot fertilizer zone is
superior to a 10-foot fertilizer-free zone for keeping fertilizer from running into surface water bodies; B. The scientific literature that suggests no storm water runoff of applied fertilizer nutrients occurs unless a rainfall of 2 inches or more falls within a 24-hour period' C. The scientific literature that suggests 30% slow/controlled release fertilizer is more or equally protective of water quality than 50% or higher slow/controlled release fertilizer; D. The scientific literature that suggests the FDEP Model ""Prohibited Application Period"" can be followed to the extent that fertilizer will not be applied before or during a rainfall event that produces enough runoff to carry applied nutrients from a landscape. [2] ""I hereby request the documentation, including email and hard copy correspondence,  upon which the  contradiction  between Tern! Nell's  and  George Hochmuth's policy recommendations regarding urban fertilizer management and the
current FYN Florida-friendly landscaping fertilization recommendations is based.  This

Chapter 119.07(4)(d), which provides, ""...in addition to the actual cost of duplication, a
special service charge, which shall be reasonable and shall be based on the cost incurred

85. Plaintiff specifically sought in the records request dated June 9, 2011                  [see
paragraph                                                                                    59 above] a detailed estimate and justification of the costs identified by
Defendant in the  amount of                                                                  $23,940.00,  including  support for the production of

86.  In Corden v. Chief of Police, 696 So. 2d 772, 773 (Fla. 2d DCA 1996), the
court when considering a special service charge exceeding $4,000.00 for staff time, stated
that, ""An excessive charge could well serve to inhibit the pursuit of rights conferred by
the Public Records Act.""   The court in the Corden case held that, ""Because section
119.07                                                                                       (1)                                                                             (b), Florida Statutes (1995), requires special service charges to be ""reasonable,""

87.  In the instant case Defendant has not provided the Plaintiff with a detailed
explanation of the cost estimate for producing the requested documents, which are
exceedingly more expensive than those cited in the Corden case.
88.                                                                                          The  Plaintiff maintains that the  Defendant's  cost estimate  of nearly
$24,000.00 amounts to a denial of the request to review the aforementioned public
records.   The estimated costs associated with reviewing the public records are excessive
in nature and such charges would only serve to extinguish the Plaintiffs rights conferred
by the Public Records Act.
89.                                                                                          These excessive costs for reviewing emails exchanged and other regular
business records and/or communications between public officials has a chilling effect
upon any future public record request made to the Defendant.
90. Unless the Court declares the rights Plaintiff and obligations of the Defendant
with regard to such records, the Plaintiff and the public at large will suffer irreparable
harm if in fact the University is violating the Sunshine Law by refusing to disclose such
records, for which there is no adequate remedy at law.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:
91.                                                                                          Declaration that the Defendant, University, failed to comply with their
statutory duty to permit the inspection and copying of public records;

available for inspection and copying at a reasonable cost to Plaintiff;
93. An Order awarding attorney's fees and costs for prosecuting this action; and
94. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

Statutes, against the University.
97.  Prior to filing this action Defendant, University, failed to comply with the
request to permit inspection and copying of public records, by claiming an exemption
without specific statutory reference.
98. Refusal to provide requested records was unlawful.
99.  The Defendant, University, provided the Plaintiff with an unreasonable cost
estimate for production and/or review of non-exempt public records, totaling nearly
$24,000.00.
100.  Requiring the Plaintiff to pay exorbitant unreasonable fees in contradiction
to Florida statute amounts to an unlawful refusal to provide requested records.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests following relief:
101. An accelerated hearing under Section 119.11(1) Fla. Stat.
102. A Declaration that the University failed to comply with its statutory duty to
permit the inspection and copying of public records;
103. An Order awarding attorney's fees and costs for prosecuting this action; and

Subject: RE: Sarasota
Terril:
Your reply only serves to make our point louder and stronger than before:
1. You have intentionally ignored the water quality/water pollution prevention issue; your
attempt to hide the fact that the ""iron instead of nitrogen"" recommendation for the
summer is under the Preventing Pollution section of the FYN Handbooks is a failure.
The recommendation is listed as one of the best ways to prevent water pollution by
numerous IFAS and FDEP publications.
After 16 years of FDEP and IFAS recommending ""iron instead of nitrogen"", if you choose
to remove that water pollution prevention recommendation from future publications you
will need to provide us with the science that substantiates any such removal.  I hereby
submit a public records request for that information if it exists.
2.                                                                                                     You have threatened to weaken UF water pollution prevention recommendations
rather than answer a perfectly legitimate request for information.
What you have accomplished is to taint the reputation of your department and UF and nothing
else. Our request for the information still stands and if I have neglected to formalize that request
in the past I do so now: I hereby submit a public records request for the information sought
in the below email dated Tuesday, July 27, 2010 4:57 PM.
In addition, in reference to your statement below: ""IFAS Extension requires review of all
EDIS publications and this procedure has been followed on all of our extension
publications.""
I hereby submit a public records request for the names, titles and contact information and
their respective reviews made prior to publication for SL 283 and ENH 1115.
From my reading of the public records law, none of these requested items are exempt from
disclosure. If I have not used the proper language or method to submit a formal public records
request please advise me of the correct manner to do so.
Let me remind you that I have attempted for over two years (since June 2008) to resolve this
issue outside of public view; any further delay will prove that your desire is to make this
conversation public.
Thank you for your prompt attention to these public records requests,

Subject: Public Records Request
Dear Ms. Sikes:
On July 29, 2010 I submitted public records requests to Terril Nell, with a copy to Jack Payne.
Because I have heard nothing since that date, I am sending the request again, to you, in order to
ensure that it has been correctly submitted and will be correctly processed.
In the below email chain you will find my previous public records requests, however, I here
restate those requests:
1. Terril Nell was quoted in the article Retail Group Dumps Fertilizer Ban
http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/retail-group-dumps-fertilizer-ban-0. Nell
stated: ""We are not able to support fertilizer management recommendations unless we
can document the science upon which they are based."" ""The state model ordinance is
backed by sound science and we are recommending that cities and counties adopt this
ordinance until additional science is available.""
I hereby request the ""science upon which"" the urban ""fertilizer management
recommendations"" in the ""state model ordinance"" are based; this includes:
A.   The scientific literature that suggests a 3-foot fertilizer-free zone is superior to a
10-foot fertilizer-free zone for keeping fertilizer from running into surface water
bodies;
B.                                                                                                  The scientific literature that suggests no storm water runoff of applied fertilizer
nutrients occurs unless a rainfall of 2 inches or more falls within a 24-hour period;
C.   The scientific literature that suggests 30% slow/controlled release fertilizer is
more or equally protective of water quality than 50% or higher slow/controlled release
fertilizer;
D.   The scientific literature that suggests the FDEP Model ""Prohibited Application
Period"" can be followed to the extent that fertilizer will not be applied before or during
a rainfall event that produces enough runoff to carry applied nutrients from a
landscape.
2.                                                                                                  At the municipal, county and state level Terril Nell and George Hochmuth have
repeatedly promoted fertilizer management recommendations that are in direct conflict
with the FYN Florida-friendly landscaping fertilization recommendations.

•                                                                                                     •
I hereby request the documentation, including email and hard copy correspondence,
upon which the contradiction between Terril Nell's and George Hochmuth's policy
recommendations regarding urban fertilizer management and the current FYN Florida-
friendly landscaping fertilization recommendations is based. Thi"

01 2013 CA 002658,Discrimination,"The Plaintiff, DANA PETERSON, by and through his undersigned attorney, hereby files
this Complaint against the Defendant, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, and hereby alleges as
follows: This is an action for damages in excess of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000),
exclusive of attorney fees and costs, and for relief under Florida Statute 760.10, The
Florida Civil Rights Act.The Plaintiff has exhausted administrative remedies necessary for the commencement of this action and has received a Cause determination from the Florida Commission on Human Relations. The Plaintiff, DANA PETERSON, was employed by the Defendant, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, since 1987. The Plaintiff became the director of the AIM program in the spring of 1997. The AIM program was a race-neutral program, which provided assistance to first year students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The Plaintiff was instrumental in the development of the program and was generally credited as the ""founder"" of the program. While director of the program, the Plaintiff consistently received positive evaluations from administration and was well-liked by students. In 2004, the Plaintiff was promoted to Senior Lecturer. In 2008, UF's Associate Provost for Undergraduate Affairs, Dr. Wubah, announced his plans to merge the AIM program with OASIS, formerly the Office for Minority Affairs. UF's current Provost, Dr. Glover, suggested that the merger was a bad idea and the merger did not happen. In 2009, Dr. Wubah left OF and the Provost, Dr. Glover, started a search committee for a new Associate Provost. The Plaintiff was a member of that hiring committee and noticed the first signs of racial preference in employment decisions with the hiring of Dr. Bernard Mair, who is African-American. The committee found that a white female was the most qualified candidate for the position; however Dr. Mair, who had little undergraduate affairs experience at the time, was selected by the Provost, who cited diversity as a reason. After the committee meeting, another member of the committee told the Plaintiff that undergraduate education to be black. In 2009, the Plaintiff was again promoted. This time to Master Lecturer, the highest position in his academic line. In March 2010, the new Associate Provost for Undergraduate Affairs, Dr. Mair, informed Dr. Peterson that he intended to merge the AIM and OASIS offices and hire a new director. Associate Provost, Dr. Mair was permitted to appoint the new director. Mair formed a search committee for the new director position. Dr. Mair told the Plaintiff that he would have to consider the feelings of the Black Alumni Association in the selection of the new director and merger of the two programs. Before the committee had even begun deliberations, Dr. Mair also told the Plaintiff that if he didn't get selected, he could apply for the assistant director position. Plaintiff is a white male. One of the members of the search committee told the Plaintiff that he would be perfect for the job, if only he were black. The Plaintiff reported this to the Provost, Dr. Glover. The Plaintiff was not selected for the position, even though he was more qualified and experienced than the other candidates. Criteria for the position included having held an administrative position and experience
in program development. Plaintiff had experience in both administration and program development. The candidate, an African American female who was selected by Dr. Mair, did not have those minimum qualifications. The Plaintiff expressed his concerns to both Dr. Mair and Dr. Glover that the search was unfairly biased against him because he was white. The Plaintiff requested the notes from the interview process and was told by Dr. Mair,
""Well, I'm not saying that you didn't get 80% of the support."" After expressing his objections to Dr. Mair about the search process and the bias against him, a series of employment related retaliations against the Plaintiff began. Plaintiff agreed to help with the merger transition, even though he was not selected for the new director position. Plaintiff did not agree to accept what he deemed a demotion by filling the associate
director of the OAS office position, which would have transitioned him from a director
of a successful program to an associate director. After expressing objections about his treatment to his supervisors, Plaintiff, for the first time in his career at the University of Florida, did not receive the average merit increase that other faculty members received. He received a 3% increase at a time when the merit raise pool for faculty that year was set at 4%. This below-average merit increase of 3% was given even though there had not been a formal evaluation of Plaintiff completed. This was in violation of the Faculty contract. In addition, Plaintiff was not afforded the opportunity to discuss the merit increase prior to its submission to the payroll department, which was in violation of the Faculty contract. After becoming aware of the below-average merit increase and pointing out the failure of administration to provide Plaintiff with an evaluation pursuant to the Faculty contract, only then was Plaintiff was informed by Dr. Mair that he would produce an evaluation. Plaintiff was then presented with the first negative evaluation he had ever received during his over 20 years of employment at the University of Florida. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff was then presented with a letter of non-renewal of his contract. Plaintiff was led to believe during this time that another position that would utilize his experience and talents would develop, and was told by Dr. Glover that the Provost Office would provide financial support for any position that he could find on campus for up to three years. Plaintiff was then assigned to positions below his academic credentials and prior work experience, which was basically clerical work. Plaintiff filed a complaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations, which investigated the complaint and, on June 29th 2012, returned with a Notice of Determination, which found Cause to believe that an unlawful employment practice occurred. COUNT I — DISCRIMINATION Plaintiff re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth within During Plaintiffs employment, Plaintiff was discriminated against based upon his race, in violation Florida Civil Rights Act. Plaintiff was director of a successful program and the most qualified candidate for the new director position that was created from the merger of AIM and OASIS. Defendant could have appointed the position, but chose to form a search committee and list qualifications for the new director. Plaintiff, a white male, met all of the criteria listed for the position. Defendant, through Assistant Provost Dr. Mair, chose an African American female, who did not meet all of the criteria listed for the position. Defendant eliminated Plaintiffs position and then created a new position, using race as a factor in the hiring process. Defendant filled the position with a candidate that would satisfy both the Black Alumni Association and President Machen's desire that the face of undergraduate education be black. Plaintiff was adversely impacted, as his position was eliminated and he was not given proper consideration for the newly created position, due to his race. As a result of the Defendant's conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the nature of emotional distress, loss of dignity, loss of professional reputation, physical distress, lost wages, lost benefits, both past and present, and has been required to retain the services of an attorney.COUNT II — RETALIATION Plaintiff re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein. During his term of employment, Plaintiff was subjected to retaliation in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act. Plaintiff objected to the discriminatory process for selection of the new director position created with the merger of AIM and OASIS. After Plaintiffs objection, Defendant began a series of retaliatory actions. Defendant gave Plaintiff a below-average merit increase for the first time in his career at the University of Florida. When informed by Plaintiff that he had never received his evaluation, Defendant created and provided Plaintiff with the first below-average evaluation he received during his career at the University of Florida. Defendant then notified Plaintiff that his contract was not being renewed for the first time in 20 years. Subsequently, Defendant placed Plaintiff in a position that was a clerical position. Prior to his objection to the discriminatory process referred to above, Plaintiff had been promoted to Master Lecturer, the highest rank in his academic line, and was the longtime Director of the successful AIM program. Defendant, through Dr. Glover, denied Plaintiff the opportunity to be hired to a 12-month contract by the College of Fine Arts. The 12-month contract would have increased benefits over the 9-month contract Plaintiff was working under. As recently as January 3, 2013, Defendant again issued Plaintiff a Notice of Non-Renewal, which was another violation of the faculty contract. As a result of the Defendant's conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the nature of emotional distress, loss of dignity, loss of professional reputation, physical distress, lost wages, lost benefits, both past and present, and has been required to retain the services of an attorney. COUNT III — NEGLIGENT SUPERVISION, TRAINING OR RETENTION Plaintiff re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein. Pursuant to the Florida Civil Rights Act, Defendant had a statutory duty to make non-discriminatory decisions regarding employment. Defendant made personnel and hiring decisions based on race. Plaintiff objected to the discriminatory hiring decisions and process to Dr. Mair, Dr. Glover, and Human Resources. Rather than conduct an investigation, cure the discriminatory process, and comply with the Florida Civil Rights Act. employees of Defendant allowed the discriminatory hiring decision to stand. In addition, subsequent to the Plaintiffs objection to the discriminatory hiring decision and process, employees of Defendant retaliated against the Plaintiff in violation of law. Because Plaintiff informed Human Resources, Defendant knew or should have known that its employees were either improperly trained on non-discriminatory hiring practices, improperly supervised, or improperly retained in a position of authority by Defendant. As a result of the Defendant's conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the nature of emotional distress, loss of dignity, loss of professional reputation, physical distress, lost wages, lost benefits, both past and present, and has been required to retain the services of an attorney."
01 2013 CA 002724,Cheating,"Upon consideration of appellant's response to the Court's order of May 1, 2013, the Court
has determined that review of the order on appeal is properly sought by petition for writ of certiorari in the circuit court. Fla. R. App. P. 9.160(b)(3); see Decker v. University of West Florida, 85 So. 3d 571 (Fla. 1st DCA 2012). Accordingly, and pursuant to Florida Rule of • Appellate Procedure 9.040(b)(1), the cause is hereby transferred to the Eighth Circuit Court in and for Alachua County. Appellee's motion to dismiss, filed on April 30, 2013, is denied. Petitioner Pro Se, Felicia A. Wider-Lewis replies to the court's order to
show cause regarding jurisdiction as follows: At the time petitioner filed the notice
of appeal, she was unaware of this court's president announced in Decker. See
Decker v. University of West Florida, 85 So.3d 571,573 (Fla. 15` DCA 2012).  She
remained unaware of it until the court reiterated this position in Corbin on April 4th
of this year.  See Corbin v. Univ. of Florida, 38 Fla. L. Weekly D759 (Fla. 1st
DCA Apr. 4, 2013). Petitioner incorporated both decisions into her reply brief and
acknowledged that in cases such as the petitioner's the First District Court of
Appeals will treat the notice of appeal and initial brief as a writ of certiorari and
transfers the case to the court of appropriate jurisdiction. As each party acknowledged in their respective pleadings, jurisdiction over this matter lies with the Eight Circuit court in Alachua County. However, contrary to the University of Florida's position in its motion to dismiss, a naked dismissal of this appeal is not the appropriate action. Each of the three cases cited in the University's motion to dismiss treated the initial pleading of the appellant as a petition for writ of certiorari and transfers the case to the appropriate court. There is no cause why this Honorable Court should not transfer the matter to the court with jurisdiction and direct the initial
pleadings of the petitioner be treated as a Petition for Writ of Certiorari.
Wherefore, petitioner prays this Honorable Court consider the Notice of
Appeal and Initial Brief as a Petition for Writ of Certiorari and transfer this matter
to the Eight Circuit in Alachua County. Appellant, Felicia Wider-Lewis, timely appeals the findings and recommendations of the University of Florida Student Conduct Committee
(`SCC') , as well as the decision and order of Dean of Student Affairs, Jen Day
Shaw, (`Dean') upholding those findings, imposing sanctions, and suspending the
appellant for violation of the university's student honor code's prohibition of
""Unauthorized Use of Materials or Resources"" proscribed in 6C1-4.041(3)(b)(3),
by allegedly ""cheating"" on her August 27th 2012 Doctoral Qualifying Examination
in Special Education. The facts that give rise to this case and appeal are as follows: Appellant was a doctoral student in the Special Education Doctoral Program of the University of Florida. Ms. Wider-Lewis was recommended by her professors to sit for the
Qualifying Examination. On the examination date, Ms. Wider-Lewis arrived on-
time at the faculty office, which was the location designated by her committee for
her to take the exam. She waited in the reception with a faculty employee named
Vicky Tucker until the designated proctor arrived and escorted her to the faculty
computer terminal on which she took her qualifying exam. Faculty secretary,
Shira Rivas-Otero, who proctored the exam, testified she observed appellant take
the exam on August 27th by checking-in on her several times throughout the exam
period and she observed no irregularities in appellant's test taking. On September 5th, the chair of her committee emailed the appellant requesting she attend a
meeting to be held on September 7th. At that meeting, which was held in the office
of the department chair rather than committee chair's office as originally noticed,
each chairperson and a professor who appeared by telephone interrogated the
appellant about her response to question two and her preparation for the exam.
Appellant responded intelligently and knowledgeably to all of the faculty's
questions and offered her notes, research, references, and all means of preparation,
for their inspection. On September 12th 2012, appellant's committee chair sent
appellant an email which scheduled a retake of day one of the exam in thirteen
days on September 25th 2012. Due to family and other obligations, as well as
emotional disenchantment with her program, Mrs. Wider-Lewis did not prepare in
the same fashion for the retake exam. After she completed the retake, appellant's committee chair advised that the oral portion of the exam had been cancelled and asked appellant to appear at another meeting. When appellant inquired whether she could or should bring counsel to the proposed meeting with her, the department chair then sent appellant an email cancelling the proposed meeting and formally charging the appellant with a violation of academic dishonesty.
Prior to the original August 27th exam, Professor Gagnon had twice emailed
appellant a verbatim copy of the exact question that later appeared as Question Two. Professor Gagnon sent appellant an email calling her into his office for a
meeting nearly three weeks prior to the exam. At that meeting, Professor Gagnon
reviewed a draft response appellant wrote for the question he had emailed her. He
also provided specific guidance on ways appellant should improve her response,
specific resources to be referenced, and directions concerning finding additional
references.  The appellant prepared for this exam question by drafting, revising,
and repetitively writing-out her practice response to it on a daily basis. The
appellant was never told and had no way of knowing that the same question she
used for preparation would appear verbatim, unchanged on the exam itself. At the
hearing, Professor Gagnon stated that he likes to give the exact question because
""it takes away the anxiety and the stress."" Appellant testified that she attended a
fellowship meeting in which the committee chair advised the entire group that
students will have the ""exam topics"" well in advanced, but not the exact question.
At the hearing, the same committee chair testified ""it is up to the individual
professors to decide whether to give the exact question or not.""
The SCC held its hearing beginning on November 15th 2012 at 9AM. In the
early afternoon, Professor Gagnon requested the SCC hearing be continued, stating
that he had a doctor's appointment scheduled for 2PM.  The hearing was then
stopped until the SCC reconvened on November 29th. On the first day of the
hearing, SCC members asked appellant what specific materials she used to study and prepare for the exam question. Mrs. Wider-Lewis sought to direct the SCC
member's attention to the articles she cited in the exam response which she had
submitted for inclusion in her hearing binder, but Amanda Hambleton who was the
Assistant Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution committee had
elected to exclude these items. Ms. Hambleton provided no rationale, written or
otherwise, for excluding these or any other items, and provided no notice that she
had in fact excluded them. Appellant requested to arrange for a stenographer to be
present at her expense to record the proceedings. The university advised that the
rules do not permit this. However, the university made its own audio recording of
the proceedings, and refused to provide a copy thereof to appellant. Appellant was
immediately sanctioned with an expulsion that forbade her from setting foot on the
University of Florida campus under threat of criminal trespass. Due to the official
sanction, appellant is prohibited from going in to the UF Student Conduct and
Conflict Resolution (`SCCR') office to inspect the record as authorized under the
UF regulations. Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, Jeanna Mastrodicasa, mitigated
the original sanction from expulsion to suspension, as a result of appellant's appeal
to the Dean of Student affairs. However, the university has provided no notice of
lifting the criminal trespass threat. The appeal to the Dean of Student Affairs
resulted in the Dean upholding the prior decisions regarding responsibility. The University of Florida conducted disciplinary proceedings against the
appellant that lacked adequate substantive and procedural safeguards of fairness
for the appellant, resulting in an unjust decision that was not based on competent
substantial evidence. The findings and recommendations of the SCC, as well as
the final decision of Dean Shaw, departed from the essential requirements of law.
The University's case against appellant was based solely upon circumstantial
evidence that does not preponderate over appellant's reasonable explanation of her
superior performance on Question 2 of Day One Exam. Appellant reasonably
explains her superior performance on the exam question in question with the facts
that her professor furnished her (1) the exact question verbatim as appeared on the
exam, and (2) detailed guidance as to how to produce a response to his satisfaction,
(3) including specific sources to be cited; (4) where no such question, guidance, or
sources were provided for any of the other exam questions. Given her super-
adequate preparation exclusively for that exact question, appellant's superior
performance on it was to be reasonably expected. The SCC's findings relied heavily on testimony and evidence that would not be admissible if offered as evidence in a trial under the Florida Rules of Evidence. Further, the evidence the SCC relied upon was not ""information upon which reasonable, prudent persons would rely in the conduct of their affairs"" sufficient to meet the standard contained in the Regulation of the University of Florida. The SCC afforded undue deference to improper, irrelevant generalized statements given by professors as testimony which had probative value that was substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice and confusion of issues those statements created. This undue deference to improper testimony from the professors amounted to granting the
professors unlimited discretion concerning alleged violations of the Student Honor
Code, resulting arbitrary and capricious recommendations and decisions against
the appellant causing her great harm and damages. This is akin to the situation
described in Chief Judge Casanueva's concurrence in LaRose and the University of
Tampa v. A.K. ""An overbroad reading of the University's definition of plagiarism,
coupled with the University's position that intent to plagiarize is not required to
constitute a violation of the academic code, arguably results in almost unlimited
discretion afforded to faculty to determine whether a student plagiarized a paper.""
LaRose v. A.K., 37 So. 2d 265 (Fla. 2d DCA 2009).                                     (The court upheld student
A.K.'s injunction because she would likely suffer irreparable harm from an adverse
decision of the University's and she had a meritorious defense.)
The SCC utterly failed to weigh or even consider any of the copious
exculpatory evidence appellant presented. This exculpatory evidence included: (1)
testimony of university officials who monitored the two examinations who each stated that all university and department procedures were followed during the
testing and that they each observed no irregularities, (2) faculty's own
investigation of its own computer used for the August 27th 2012 exam revealed no
evidence of any downloads or tampering, (3) appellant voluntarily submitted her
cellular phone records which revealed no calls or data transmissions were made or
received during the examination time, and (4) no source for the writings other than
appellant herself was ever identified.
The SCC's internally inconsistent written rationale applied a vague,
meaningless, and unfair standard to improperly conclude appellant violated the
Student Honor Code. Even assuming the truth of all the ""facts"" cited by the SCC's
rationale; the conduct described does not establish a violation of the letter the
provision of the Student Honor Code which appellant was charged with violating.
The SCC only reached its conclusions by way of an evidentiary presumption that is
not authorized by any statue, regulation of the University of Florida, or by any
court of law, finding that ""clear differences"" among writing samples is conclusive
proof of use of unauthorized material or resources. This irrebuttable presumption
unlawfully shifted the burden to appellant to prove the negative that she did not use
unauthorized material or resources on the August 27th exam.
Beyond the SCC's departures from the essential requirements of law
protecting appellant's substantive rights described above, the University violated appellant's procedural due process rights. A OF Student Conduct and Conflict
Resolution (`SCCR') official abused her discretion by arbitrarily removing relevant
exculpatory evidence from appellant's hearing evidence binder. The university
further violated the appellant's procedural due process rights by permitting her
accusers to participate in the deliberations concerning both responsibility and
recommendation, outside of appellant's presence. The university denied appellant
her procedural right to make a record of the proceedings and denied appellant
access to the record the university made of those proceedings. In sum, by
employing an unauthorized evidentiary presumptions based on incompetent,
irrelevant circumstantial evidence, by ignoring the greater weight of the evidence
which manifestly favored the appellant, and by erecting unfair insurmountable
procedural obstacles in appellant's path, the university created a .completely
uneven playing field for appellant to defend herself against the charge of her
accuser and a machine for rubberstamping allegations founded only upon a
professor's mere suspicion. 
THE SCC FINDINGS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY COMPETENT SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
The Student Conduct Committee (`SCC') relied on testimony and other
evidence which could not be admitted under the Florida Rules of Evidence. The
evidence the SCC relied upon fails even to meet the far lesser standard of evidence
delineated in the Regulations of the University of Florida. Aside from the
unreliable and incompetent evidence from which SCC drew improper inferences
and conclusions, there was no competent substantial evidence upon which the SCC
could reach its conclusion that appellant used unauthorized material and/or
assistance in completing the Day 1 Qualifying Exam for Special Education
Doctoral Program.
Section 120.68(7)(b) of the Florida Statutes (2012) states, in relevant part:
""The court shall remand a case to the agency for further proceedings
consistent with the court's decision or set aside agency action, as
appropriate, when it finds that:
(b)   The agency's action depends on any finding of fact that is not
supported by competent, substantial evidence in the record of a
hearing conducted pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57; however, the
court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the
weight of the evidence on any disputed finding of fact..."" Over the objections of appellant, four professors were permitted to provide irrelevant, bolstering testimony as to their past experience with students other than the appellant in years past. This testimony held no probative value regarding whether appellant used unauthorized material on the August 27th exam. See §90.401 Fla. Stat. (2012). This testimony, however, was highly and unfairly prejudicial to the appellant's defense, confused the issues, and misled the SCC members. See §90.403 Fla. Stat. (2012). The written rationale of the SCC
Hearing Recommendations reflect this confusion and prejudice in the penultimate
statement ""The testimony of the professors that the style of writing used on initial
Question 2 was 'unlike' anything they saw previously from the student and was
`unlike' other peer submissions in all their collective years of experience.""
Regarding ""other peer submissions,"" this rationale is a vague comparison showing
no qualitative distinctions between any specific aspects of any two writing samples
compared to one another under any reasonable articulated standard. The testimony
this rationale is based upon is not proper opinion or reputation evidence, but is
instead irrelevant, broad generalizations. Even if true, the fact that appellant's
response was ""unlike"" other peer submission from doctoral students who took the
exam in years past has no tendency in logic to prove or disprove any material fact
of the allegation that appellant used unauthorized materials to produce her response
to question 2 of day one's exam. This alleged dissimilarity with all pervious ""peer submissions"" served only to create unfair prejudice and to induce the trier of fact to
wrongly conclude that some vague dissimilarity amongst responses or the
uniqueness of a response in itself is evidence of ""cheating"" ,on an exam.  This error
was clearly not harmless because it patently influenced the SCC's conclusion,
appeared prominently in the SCC's written rationale, and is at the core of the
decision. The final statement of the written rationale further reveals the extreme
deference and bias fostered in the SCC members by the improper bolstering
testimony of the professors. It reads ""The number of citation on both question 2
submissions was far + above any other submissions of students who far
exceeded the writing style of the student."" This is yet another vague and unfair
comparison to unidentified works of students in the past according to unspecified
criteria. The improper testimony of Professor Gagnon at the hearing was ""No
student could possibly produce 41 citations."" However, Prof. Gagnon had to later
admit in the hearing that he, along with the other professors that observed her,
personally witnessed the appellant produced the exact same number of citations on
the second take of the exam question. The SCC contorted and distorted this fact
which is in fact in appellant's favor to illogically mean that producing the same
number of citations on the second taking is somehow indicative of cheating
because it is still a number of citations that is ""far + above any other submissions of students who far exceeded the writing style of the student."" Any generalized
reference to ""other submissions"" of other students should have been stricken
because such evidence does not constitute competent evidence.
The remaining so called ""findings of fact"" made by the SCC are immaterial
and irrelevant to proving an unauthorized use of materials or resources in violation
of ""Student Honor Code. The SCC held Mrs. Wider-Lewis responsible for
violation of ""Student Honor Code/3(b)/3b3,"" [sic] which reads as follows:"

pending review by the Ethics Commission, Dan McCoy and Tom Dana had been prohibited from ""any
kind of involvement in College of Education or OF procurement. They will not be involved in contracting
or making purchases."" A true and correct copy of an article in the Friday, September 20, 2013 edition of
the Gainesville Sun is attached as Exhibit ""C"".

18.                                                                                                            As a result of the demotion of McCoy and Dana, Plaintiff and Plaintiffs counsel were directed to
the University of Florida's Office of the General Counsel to resolve the payment on Edutech's outstanding
invoice.
19.                                                                                                            Defendant University of Florida, through its Office of the General Counsel, repeatedly told the
Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel that the Defendant's position was that the Defendant had not received
enough information to determine whether Defendant would pay Edutech the invoiced amount of $48,000.
Counsel for Defendant requested additional documentation from Plaintiff and said that Defendant could
not make a determination until Counsel for Defendant had conferred with Dan McCoy.
16.                                                                                                            Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel met with and had communications with attorneys for the
Defendant multiple times in 2013 and 2014, and did not received a definitive answer as to whether or not
Defendant would pay EduTech Solutions for the $48,000 invoice, until a February 7, 2014 meeting.
17.                                                                                                            The last communication between Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel with an attorney for the
University of Florida was at a face to face meeting at the University of Florida on February 7, 2014. At
that meeting, Defendant's counsel indicated that she had finally had an opportunity to confer with ""her
client"" Dan McCoy. Based on Dan McCoy's false assertion that no agreement ever existed
between the College of Education and Edutech, Defendant's counsel announced to Plaintiff and
Plaintiffs counsel, at the face to face meeting on February 7, 2014, that the University had
decided not to pay Plaintiffs invoice.
18. A true and correct copy of the email sent to Counsel for Defendants just prior to the February 7, 2014
meeting is attached as Exhibit ""D"".
19. The February 7, 2014 announcement by Defendant's counsel at the meeting with Plaintiff and
Plaintiff's counsel amounted to an actual or constructive discharge of the Plaintiff by the Defendant, and
constitute an adverse personnel action against the Plaintiff prohibited by the Whistleblower Statute, as the
adverse action was taken against the Plaintiff by the Defendant because of, or in retaliation for, the prior
protected disclosures made by the Plaintiff.

learning platforms and expand and integrate its online virtual education programs. and
Whereas Edutech Solutions EEC (ESL), has expertise in intellectual property. virtual
education, education policy analysis. revenue models. business plan development.

Commission on Ethics
From January to June of this year, Tom Griffin consulted with UF's College of Education to
consider ways to build a virtual academy at UF for accelerated high school students in
Florida.  Mr. Griffin has learned that Utrinsic LLC may be doing business illegally with the
College of Education to develop and produce courses for the newly approved Institute for
Online Learning, in violation of Florida's Code of Ethics for Public Officers and Employees.
The Code prohibits public employees from diverting agency-related business to
themselves for private gain.
Utrinsic LLC is a private company in Florida which officially incorporated on March 6.
2013,                                                                                           (Exhibit 7) and has four managing members: Matthew Hintze (Utrinsic CEO), a
former UF professor and former owner of TutoringZone, and three current College of
Education officers:  Senior Director Daniel McCoy (also President of Utrinsic), Mark
Dinsmore, and Jason Arnold. (Id., see also Exhibit 1) On June                                   13, 2013. Associate
Dean Tom Dana, Mr. McCoy's immediate supervisor at the College of Education. signed,
reviewed and approved Utrinsic's UF vendor application which references a renewable,
annual contract between the College and Utrinsic as of May                                      1. 2013. (Exhibit 8) Mr.
Griffin's UF public records request found no information about Utrinsic being subjected to a
competitive bid process.
According to the Utrinsic business plan submitted to Dean Dana on February 22, 2013, Mr.
Hintze placed a value of $59,393,144 on Utrinsic, despite Utrinsic having no investors, no
employees, and no valuable intellectual property or assets.                                     (Exhibit 4, p.                                                                41)                      The
operating agreement Mr. Hintze sent to Mr. Griffin on February 10. 2013 lists Mr. Hintze as
owning a 15% equity share in Utrinsic. Messrs. McCoy and Dinsmore, are listed as owning
a                                                                                               14% share. and Mr. Arnold is listed with a 5% share of the company.           (Exhibit 3, p. B-1) If
Mr. Hintze's calculations are correct, Messrs. Hintze, McCoy and Dinsmore increased their
worth $8 - $9 million immediately upon incorporation. Mr. Hintze's valuation of Utrinsic is
entirely derived from the company's anticipation, using insider connections at the University
of Florida, of diverting millions of dollars in Florida Education Finance Program funds to
Utrinsic.  Mr Hintze has taught Venture Finance at the Warrington School of Business at
UF.  This summer. he was a UF adjunct faculty member teaching high schoolers in UF's
""Young Entrepreneurs for Leadership and Sustainability"" program.                                (Exhibit 9)
Utrinsic's vendor application, submitted by Mr. Hintze and approved by Dean Dana, states
that Utrinsic is conducting ""activities including, but not limited to, instructional design,

course development and production of online courses for the Online Institute at UF.""
(Exhibit 8) Utrinsic is currently leasing office space from Innovation Hub at the University
of Florida, according to manager Gayle Dykeman, and will be moving, in six weeks into a
space provided for Utrinsic at the College of Education.
Mr. Griffin believes the leadership of Utrinsic has taken steps to conceal its conflict of
interest with the University. On May                                                                1. 2013. Mr. Hintze gave false information to UF on
Utrinsic's vendor application by denying any former employment with the University.                 (Id.)
However. UF personnel records show Mr. Hintze has held different jobs with UF since
1997, including: visiting lecturer, pre-doctoral fellow, student assistant, graduate assistant.
and graduate research assistant.                                                                    (Exhibit 9) When he applied for the adjunct faculty
position a month later, Mr. Hintze did include his former UF employment as a finance
professor on his resume. (Id.)  His resume indicates he founded Utrinsic in 2011, despite
the March 6, 2013 incorporation date recorded with the Florida Department of State.                 (Id.,
see also Exhibit 7) His resume also indicates Mr. Hintze's professional experience as a
consultant for the College of Education since 2012, even though a UF public records
request provided no such evidence. (Id.) Mr. Hintze is currently a defendant in an
adversary proceeding in personal bankruptcy for making alleged misrepresentations to
multiple creditors. In re Hintze, Case No.                                                          12-10462-KKS (U.S. Bankruptcy Court, N.D.
Fla.                                                                                                2012)
Despite his key role in Mr. Griffin's allegations of corrupt and illegal behavior. Mr. Hintze
ultimately may not be held legally accountable under the Code of Ethics. The Code applies
to candidates, lobbyists, and officers or employees of public agencies like UF. and would
probably not apply to Mr. Hintze for falsely presenting himself as a College of Education
consultant. Mr. Griffin's complaint singles out Mr. McCoy, Senior Director of E-Learning,
Technology, and Creative Services at the College of Education, and a principal managing
member of Utrinsic.  Mr. McCoy's official duties include the procurement of contractual
services for the College. According to his biographic description at the College's website,
Mr. McCoy is ""currently coordinating efforts in e-learning, software development,
communications and business development for the College of Education."" (Exhibit 1)
On October 23, 2012, Mr. McCoy's wife submitted an approved invoice to Dean Dana for
services performed for her husband's department at the College of Education. Her
website, Egensteinermedia.com, lists her husband's department at the College of
Education. E-learning, Technology and Creative Services (ETC), as a past client.
(Appendix A)  Mr. McCoy's involvement in procuring services for the College of Education
from either Utrinsic or his wife's company would violate state law. as it is illegal for a public

university official to procure, directly or indirectly, contractual services for his own agency
from any business entity of which the official or his spouse has a material interest.
On February 21, 2013, Matthew Hintze and Daniel McCoy used confidential information
from a legal memorandum prepared for UF's General Counsel by Mr. Griffin and Mr.
Griffin's attorney, to lobby at the state capitol for their personal benefit.                       (Exhibit 5; see
E-mail from Griffin to McCoy and Dana, February 22, 2013, Composite Exhibit 6, p.
1)                                                                                                  It is generally unlawful for a public employee to use information obtained in the course of
his official duties for personal gain, if the information is not readily available to the public.
Purporting to represent UF, Messrs. McCoy and Hintze travelled together to Tallahassee
on February 21st and lobbied Kathy Mizereck, Staff Director for the House Education
Committee, for the proposed legislation based on confidential information in the legal
memorandum.  The confidential legal memorandum concerned UF's ability to claim public
funding for a virtual education program. The proposed legislation, never approved by UF.
would have increased funds for the Utrinsic project. (Id.)
Prior to his lobbying trip. Mr. McCoy admitted to Mr. Griffin and others that UF Provost Joe
Glover had ""ordered"" him not to lobby at the capitol without the express permission of Jane
Adams, Vice President of University Relations. and President Bernie Machen. Mr. McCoy
falsely told College of Education leaders at a February                                             18. 2013 meeting that he had been
invited to join Mr. Hintze for a confirmed meeting with House Speaker Wetherford that
week, when in fact, there was no such meeting (Id.). Mr. McCoy did not obtain approval
from Ms. Adams or President Machen to lobby for the proposed legislation.
Mr. Griffin alleges that a constant flow of College of Education information. not available to
the public, was disclosed by Mr. McCoy to Mr. Hintze for the personal gain of both.
Specifically, information about what courses would be offered in coming years was
provided by Mr. McCoy to Mr. Hintze.  In an e-mail from Mr. Hintze dated January 9, 2013,
Mr. Hintze makes financial projections based on future course projections received from
Mr. McCoy. (Appendix B) Unpublished information about future course offerings offers
Mr. Hintze a huge advantage over any outside concern which might wish to compete for
business with the College of Education.
Mr. Griffin is filing this complaint with the Florida Ethics Commission to protect the public,
and to distance himself and two College of Education employees, John Donaldson and
Aaron Thomas, from any illegal actions undertaken by Utrinsic. The three were part of the
original Utrinsic working group led by Senior Director Mr. McCoy, before the illegal
intentions of the company leadership to divert public funds to itself were revealed. The

Utrinsic working group was originally tasked by Mr. McCoy to create a legitimate 'spin-off.
company through UF's Office of Technology and Licensing. However, Mr. McCoy did not
obtain the President and the Chair of the University's Board of Trustee's required approval
before becoming a managing member of Utrinsic.  The Utrinsic business plan was
organized and edited by Mr. McCoy in his official position at the College of Education,
using College resources, personnel, and meeting space.
On January 5, 2013, Mr. Griffin sent an email to the Utrinsic working group and his private
attorney inquiring about the legality of UF contracting with Utrinsic to provide services to a
proposed virtual academy at UF's laboratory school.                                                 (Exhibit                                                     2). Mr. Griffin insisted that
Mr. McCoy schedule. as soon as possible. a meeting with the UF General Counsel's office
for guidance.
On February 10, 2013, Mr. Hintze e-mailed an offer of equity in Utrinsic to Messrs. McCoy.
Dinsmore, Arnold. Griffin. Thomas, and Donaldson. At the scheduled February 20.                     2013
meeting. the General Counsel directly advised Mr. McCoy not to procure contractual
services from a private company to create online courses which UF could produce
in-house.  The meeting was also attended by Mr. McCoy, the Dean of the College of
Education, Dean Dana, and an Assistant General Counsel (by speakerphone).
On February 22, 2013. Mr. Griffin e-mailed Mr. McCoy and Dean Dana to refuse Utrinsic's
equity offer, citing a conflict of interest with Mr. Griffin's consulting work for the College of
Education.  On February 24. 2013, College of Education officer Aaron Thomas e-mailed
his refusal.  On February 26,                                                                       2011, College of Education officer John Donaldson e-mailed
his refusal, citing conflict of interest concerns.                                                  (Composite Exhibit 6) Their e-mails
refusing equity in Utrinsic are included in this complaint.                                         (Id.) On March 6.                                            2013,
Gainesville CPA Marc Schnoll submitted Utrinsic's Articles of Incorporation to the Florida
Department of State. and listed Messrs. Hintze, McCoy. Dinsmore and Arnold as
managing members.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF ETHICS COMPLAINT
Daniel McCoy, based on the facts set forth above, has violated the following
provisions of Florida law:
Violation of Florida Statute 112.3185(6)
Section                                                                                          112.3185                   (6), Florida Statutes, provides

a material interest.
On June 13, 2013, Associate Dean for the College of Education. Thomas Dana, signed,
reviewed, and approved Utrinsic LLC's University of Florida Vendor Application submitted
to the UF purchasing office on May 1. 2013 by Utrinsic's principal managing member.
Matthew Hintze.   From March 6. 2013 to the present, Daniel McCoy has been an equity
shareholder and managing member of Utrinsic. LLC, Mr. McCoy's current employment as
as Senior Director of E-learning, Technology and Creative Services (ETC) for the UF
College of Education, predates his becoming a managing member of Utrinsic. Dean Dana
is Mr. McCoy's direct supervisor at the College of Education, and has been deeply
involved in the Utrinsic project from its inception.
Utrinsic's approved vendor application references a one year contract between Utrinsic
and the College of Education, beginning May                                                      1, 2013 and ending April   30,                               2014,

Section                                                                                          112.3185   (2) as ""decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation. preparation of
any part of a purchase request. influencing the content of any specification or procurement
standard, rendering of advice, investigation, or auditing or in any other advisory capacity...
Dean Dana's approval of Utrinsic's vendor application qualifies as a prohibited
procurement activity.   Dean Dana was part of the Utrinsic working group prior to the
company's incorporation, and received all Utrinsic Google Group communications.
including e-mails from College of Education employees refusing equity in Utrinsic.
Complainant e-mailed Dean Dana the Utrinsic business plan. organized and edited by Mr.
McCoy, two months before Dean Dana approved the Utrinsic vendor application. Dean

bargaining contract with the state or any municipality, county, or other political
subdivision of the state; nor shall an officer or employee of an agency have or
hold any employment or contractual relationship that will create a continuing or

licenses. leases, assigns, or otherwise gives written consent to any person, firm, or
corporation for the manufacture or use on a royalty basis or for other consideration.
However, Mr. McCoy did not obtain the President and the Chair of the University's Board of
Trustee's approval under Section                                                                112.312                                                              (12)                                                             (h)  prior to becoming a managing member

visiting professorship position from Boston University's College of Law, which was approved by
UF's College of Law.
12.                                                                                                  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement with Defendant and a separate assignment
agreement between Defendant and Boston University, Plaintiff would receive his full UF
compensation (for salary and fringe benefits) from Defendant for his semester-long paid sabbatical
as well as his full UF compensation from Boston University, both for the fall 2015 semester.
13.                                                                                                  In exchange for assigning Plaintiff to Boston University to teach as a visiting
professor, Defendant would receive a one-time lump sum payment of $102,717.16 from Boston
University to compensate Defendant for Plaintiff's salary and benefits ($81,716.12 as salary and

relocate to Boston for the fall 2015 semester, which entailed securing housing in the Boston area
as well as leasing his Gainesville home for the same period of time.
16.                                                                                                  In June 2015, Plaintiff was informed by an administrative employee of Defendant
that a UF professor may not concurrently be on paid sabbatical leave while simultaneously holding
an assigned visiting professorship because such an action would result in receipt of double
compensation, which is allegedly prohibited by university policy. University of Florida Sabbatical
Guidelines Rules 5(h-j), however, clearly and without ambiguity permits such compensation. See
UF Sabbatical Guidelines attached hereto as Plaintiff's Exhibit C. Upon information and belief,
the University has compensated other professors in accordance with this policy, in the past and
without regard to any prohibition against double compensation.  Indeed, the receipt of double
compensation was expressly agreed to by the University at the time the parties entered into the
Settlement Agreement.
17.                                                                                                  While Plaintiff was teaching at Boston University in September 2015, Defendant
generated a Faculty Assignment Report for Plaintiff to execute, officially designating him as a
visiting professor and not on paid sabbatical leave for the fall 2015 semester. Plaintiff was then
informed by Defendant's College of Law Associate Academic Dean that the designation would
not be changed, nor would Plaintiff receive the previously agreed upon double compensation.
18.                                                                                                  This  concurrent  double  compensation  arrangement  is  exactly  what  was
contemplated by the Parties during mediation and memorialized in paragraph nine of the
Settlement Agreement.

pay to UFRF an amount equal to what Licensee would have been required to pay
to UFRF had Licensee sold the amount of Licensed Products or Licensed
Processes sold by such Sublicensee. In addition, if Licensee receives any fees,
minimum royalties, or other payments in consideration for any rights granted
under a Sublicense, and such payments are not based directly upon the amount or
value of Licensed Products or Licensed Processes sold by the Sublicensee, then
Licensee shall pay to UFRF a portion of such payments as specified in Section
4.4. Licensee shall not receive from Sublicensees anything of value in lieu of
cash payments in consideration for any Sublicense under this Agreement without
the express prior written permission of UFRF.4.4.3

its affiliates and sublicensees) is not actively researching, developing or
commercializing; (ii) is in a major commercial territory (i.e., the U.S., the E.U.,
and Japan); (iii) an identified third party desires to develop and commercialize;
and (iv) does not compete with any product which is then part of an active
research, development or commercialization program of Licensee or its affiliates
or collaborators, then UFRF shall provide written notice of such potential
product (an ""Undeveloped Product"") to Licensee. Within sixty (60) days of
receipt of such notice from UFRF, Licensee shall provide written notice to
UFRF that it elects to: (a) develop and commercialize such Undeveloped Product
itself; (b) develop and commercialize such Undeveloped Product through an
appropriate Sublicense; or (c) terminate Licensee's rights under this Agreement
solely for such Undeveloped Product.  Should Licensee elect to effect
development and commercialization of such Undeveloped Product itself or in
collaboration with one or more other parties, Licensee and UFRF shall negotiate
reasonable diligence goals, which shall be added to Appendix D within ninety
(90) days of Licensee's election. Should Licensee elect to Sublicense its rights
to the Undeveloped Product to a sublicensee identified either by itself or by
UFRF, Licensee shall negotiate in good faith and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to execute a commercially reasonable Sublicense. If no such
Sublicense is executed within six (6) months of Licensee's election, Licensee
shall either (i) provide a written report to UFRF detailing its efforts, and
continue diligent efforts to complete a Sublicense, or (ii) relinquish rights to
UFRF for such Undeveloped Product. If Licensee ceases to engage in active
negotiations to sublicense rights to the Undeveloped Product or fails to execute
such Sublicense within an additional nine (9) months, then UFRF may terminate
Licensees's rights under this Agreement only with respect to such Undeveloped
Product by providing written notice of such termination to Licensee.

UFRF and as an indication of serious intent, COMPANY shall pay to UFRF the sum of
one thousand Dollars ($1000) upon the execution of this Agreement, but no later than 30
Days from the Effective Date, such sum to be nonrefundable.
7)                                                                                              PATENT COSTS. During the Option Period, COMPANY shall reimburse UFRF for

attorneys' fees, in the Territory and incurred during the Option Period or any ensuing
period of good faith negotiations as set forth in Paragraph 2) above. Such costs shall be
reimbursed by COMPANY within thirty (30) days of invoicing by UFRF. Should UFRF
or any other licensee or optionee of Patent Rights decide to not pay any patent costs or to
otherwise abandon patents in any jurisdiction worldwide, UFRF shall notify COMPANY
at least 15 days prior to any loss of patent rights in such jurisdiction and COMPANY
shall have the right, at its expense, to maintain those rights. In such event, the new rights
will automatically be deemed to be added to the Territory as defined herein.
8)                                                                                              NO WARRANTIES. UFRF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND EXTENDS NO

MEDTRONIC refused, to agree to an audit that included any information related to t o product
families, ZephyrLIFE and Vital Sync (the ""DISPUTED PRODUCTS""). MEDTRONIC also
refused any audit over its products that may compete with the licensed technology, products
developed in violation of its duty to develop and, promote the licensed technology,

PRODUCTS, explaining why MEDTRONIC's unilateral exclusion of the DISPUTED
PRODUCTS from an audit is both legally incorrect and creates a                                  rial breach of the
LICENSE's audit clause. See correspondence from counsel for UFRFand MEDTRONIC,

MEDTRONIC, however, still refused to provide the full audit scope, including an audit

MEDTRONIC continued to refuse to provide the full scope of the eontr- t   Hy-
required audit. Upon infor r at ion and belief, MEDTRONIC n.ver intended to agree to the audit
at the mediation because it did not bring individuals with authority to agree, as required by the
mediator and as promised by MEDTRONIC as a condition to mediation. However,
MEDTRONIC agreed to continue to negotiate regarding an audit and executed a forbearance
agreement to delay suit while those negotiations continued.

correspondence during the first three weeks of the forbearance agreement. With only one week
remaining under the forbearance agreement, MEDTRONIC responded to IlFRF's proposals by
reverting to its pre-mediation position and refusing to negotiate regarding any of the substantive
proposals raised by tiFRF. By doing so, MEDTRONIC repudiated the forbearance agreerrient
and made clear that it had never had any interest in negotiating in good faith. Upon information
and belief, MEDTRONIC agreed to the forbearance agreement to induce UFRF to delay in filing
suit so that MEDTRONIC could prepare its own litigation, The forbearance agreement expired
on April 16. 2016.
32.                                                                                                  All of the alternate dispute resolution procedures required by the LICENSE as a

breached its duty to develop markets and sales for Licensed Products and has instead used its
exclusivity to prevent UFRF from licensing the technology to others without any benefit to

Control documents within thirty (30) days of their execution.
Termination under this Section 9.3 takes effect thirty (30) days after written
notice that is provided by UFRF according to this Section 9.3, unless Licensee
remedies the problem in that thirty (30) day period or unless a longer period for
cure is provided hereunder.
9.4                                                                                           If Licensee or any of its Affiliates brings a Patent Challenge against UFRF
or assists others in bringing a Patent Challenge against UFRF (except as required under a
court order or subpoena), then UFRF may immediately terminate this Agreement. If a
Sublicensee brings a Patent Challenge or assists another party in bringing a Patent
Challenge (for example, except as required under a court order or subpoena), then UFRF
may send a written demand to Licensee to terminate the sublicense. If Licensee fails to
terminate the Sublicense within forty-five (45) days after UFRF's demand, UFRF may
immediately terminate this Agreement.

the third separate default by Licensee within any consecutive three-year period for failure
to pay any monies due under this Agreement when due, unless the Licensee is disputing
such payment in good faith. Any payment made pursuant to Section 6.2 and 6.3 shall not
be deemed to be a default under this Section 9.5 provided that a payment was made for
the royalty period in question.
9.6                                                                                           Termination of this Agreement for any reason does not release either party
from any obligation that matured prior to the effective date of termination. Licensee
remains obligated to provide an accounting for and to pay royalties earned. Licensee
may prorate any minimum royalties that are due as of the date of termination by the
number of days elapsed in the applicable calendar year. Licensee and its Sublicensees
may, however, during the six (6) months after the effective date of termination, sell all
Licensed Products that are in inventory and complete and sell Licensed Products that are
in the process of manufacture , provided that Licensee provides an accounting for and
pays all earned royalties and other payments that are due under the terms of the
Agreement.

effective date of such termination. Licensee shall remain obligated to provide an
accounting for and to pay royalties earned to the date of termination, and any
Minimum royalties shall be prorated as of the date of termination by the number
of days elapsed in the applicable calendar year. Licensee may, however, after

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE EIGHTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
IN AND FOR ALACHUA COUNTY, FLORIDA
IN RE: CASE NO.:
LILLIAN STUMP
SHANDS AT STARKE FUND
PETITION TO MODIFY RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF FUND
The University of Florida Foundation, Inc. (Foundation), a Florida non-profit
corporation, petitions this Court to exercise its statutory authority to modify the purpose and
name of a fund so that the fund may be used consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in
the gift instrument:
1. • This Court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla.
Stat. (2016).
2. Venue for this action is pursuant to Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla. Stat. (2016).
3. The Foundation is a Florida non-profit corporation and a 501(c)(3) charitable
organization established pursuant to Section 1004.28, Fla. Stat. (2016) to raise and manage all
gift monies for the benefit of the University of Florida (University).
4. The subject matter of this petition is a gift from Lillian Stump (Donor) and five other
donors to the Foundation on behalf and for the benefit of the University.
5. In 2001, the Donor, the Foundation, the University, and Shands at Starke executed a
gift agreement setting forth the terms of the Donor's gift. The gift agreement stated that the
11

Donor's gift would be used to establish an endowment fund to be known as the ""Lillian Stump
Shands at Starke Fund"" (Fund). The purpose of the Fund was described as follows:,
The income of the Fund will be used to support teaching, research and programs at
Shands at Starke.
6. At the time, Shands at Starke was a hospital facility in Starke, Florida, operated by
Shands HealthCare and affiliated with the University since 1996. The UniVersity conducted
teaching, research, and programs at the facility.
7. After the Donor executed the gift agreement and made her gift, five other donors
contributed to the Fund. Of the total amount contributed to the Fund, the Donor gave 99 percent
and the five other donors gave 1 percent.
8. The Fund is an endowment fund and, as such, it is invested according to Foundation
policies to support its purpose in perpetuity. Spendable income from the Fund is transferred
quarterly to the University, in accordance with Foundation policies.
9. As directed by the gift agreement, the annual spendable income was made available
to support teaching, research and programs at Shands at Starke. However, in 2010, the facility
known as Shands at Starke was purchased by a third party, and the University no longer conducts
activities at the facility. As a result, the Fund has become impossible to administer in accordance
with the gift agreement.
10. As of October 2016, the market value of the principal balance was $117,387.81 and
the spendable income balance was $25,684.15. Under Foundation policies, under current
conditions, an estimated $4,410.67 would be available to the University annually, if the
University were able to use the funds.
11. To best accomplish the Donor's charitable purpose, to fulfill the Foundation's
fiduciary obligations to the Donor and to the University, and to have the University benefit from
2

the gift as intended by the Donor, it is necessary that the purpose and name of the Fund be
modified pursuant to Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla. Stat. (2016).
12. From 2011 to the present, University and Foundation staff have attempted to contact
the Donor multiple times by mail and telephone to discuss modifying the restrictions associated
with her gift. The Donor has not responded, yet mail has not been returned. The Donor is
unmarried and has no children.
13. The five other contributions were made by four individuals and one organization.
Two individuals are deceased, and the organization (the former hospital auxiliary) no longer
exists. 'On November 10, 2016, the Foundation mailed letters to the two living donors to inform
them of the Foundation's intent to file this Petition (see Exhibit 1'). No responses were received.
14. The Foundation requests that the name of the Fund be modified from ""Lillian Stump
Shands at Starke Fund"" to ""Lillian Stump Professional Nursing Education Fund.""
15. The Foundation requests that the purpose of the Fund be modified from ""...support
teaching, research and programs at Shands at Starke"" to ""...support continuing professional
education for nurses working at OF Health Shands facilities.""
16. The Foundation believes that these modifications are consistent with the Donor's
charitable intent because the Donor was a nurse and a member of the hospital auxiliary, and she
established a scholarship for nursing students at Santa Fe College.
17. The Foundation provided notice of this petition to the Attorney General of the State
of Florida as required by Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla. Stat. (2016). The Office of the Attorney
General provided a letter of objection. (See Exhibit 2.)
1 The names and addresses of the donors have been redacted to protect their identities from being revealed in a
public document. Section 1004.28(5), Florida Statutes, makes most of the Foundation's records confidential and
exempt from Section 119.07(1), Florida Statutes.
3

18. The Foundation will continue to hold, manage, and invest the Fund to be used for the
benefit of the University, in accordance with Foundation policies and the Donor's wishes as
modified by the Court.
WHEREFORE, the Foundation requests this Court to enter an Order modifying the
purpose and name of the Fund to serve the intent of the Donor to benefit the University of
Florida.
Respectfully submitted,

Re: Your contribution to the Lillian Stump Shands at Starke Fund
Dear
In 2004, you contributed to the Lillian Stump Shands at Starke Fund for the benefit of
the University of Florida. We are contacting you'about a proposed modification to the
name and purpose of the fund.
As you may recall, the fund was established to support teaching, research and
programs at Shands at Starke. However, the University of Florida is no longer affiliated
with the facility in Starke (the facility retains a similar name but is now owned by a
corporation). As a result, it has become impossible to administer the fund as originally
intended.
The fund was established at and continues to be held by the University of Florida
Foundation, Inc., which is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization and a direct-support
organization that raises and manages gift monies for the University of Florida. When a
charitable organization is unable to use gift monies as intended, a petition may be filed
with a court asking for a modification. In this case, the Foundation intends to file a
petition that requests that the name of the fund become the Lillian Stump Professional
Nursing Education Fund and that the purpose of the fund become ""...to support
continuing professional education for nurses working at OF Health Shands facilities.""
We believe that this modification is consistent with Ms. Stump's dedication to the
nursing field.
If you have any concerns about this modification, would you please contact me by
November 30, 2016, at tboonstra@uff.ufl.edu or 352-392-8418? I am a staff attorney

The Honorable Pam Bondi
Attorney General of the State of Florida
Office of the Attorney General
By email to Blaine.Winship@myfloridalegal.com
RE: Notice of Petition to Modify Restrictions on Use of Fund
Dear Attorney General Bondi:
Section 617.2104(6)(e), Florida Statutes, requires that the Attorney General be notified of a
request to a circuit court to modify the charitable purpose contained in a gift instrument.
Toward that end, we enclose a copy of a Petition to Modify Restrictions on Use of Fund that
we intend to file.
The gift instrument is a gift agreement executed in 2001. The document states that the gift
monies will be used to support activities at a facility that is no longer affiliated with the
University of Florida, thereby making the gift impossible to administer as set forth in the gift
instrument. As far as we know, the donor is living, but unfortunately she has not responded to
multiple communication attempts over 5 years. The donor is unmarried and had no children.
We intend to request that the purpose and name be modified in a manner that we believe is
consistent with the donor's interests and intent.
With respect to the enclosed petition, we note that Section 1004.28, Florida Statutes, protects
donor identities and makes most of our records confidential and exempt from Section
119.07 (1), Florida Statutes.
If you or your staff have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at (352) 392-

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE EIGHTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
I N AND FOR ALACHUA COUNTY, FLORIDA
IN RE: Estate of CASE NO.:
MARION HOUGHTELIN HART,
Deceased.
PETITION TO APPLY CY PRES DOCTRINE
The University of Florida Foundation, Inc. (Foundation), a Florida non-profit
corporation, petitions this Court to exercise its statutory authority to modify the purpose and
name of a fund so that the fund may be used consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in
the gift instrument:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla.
Stat. (2015).
2. Venue for this action is pursuant to Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla. Stat. (2015).
3. The Foundation is a Florida non-profit corporation and a 501(c)(3) charitable
organization established pursuant to Section 1004.28, Fla. Stat. (2015) to raise and manage all
gift monies for the benefit of the University of Florida (University).
4. The subject matter of this petition is the bequest described in the following paragraph,
which is presently under the control of the Foundation, and which is inactive due to a purpose
that is impracticable or impossible to achieve.
5. The Eldridge Hart Loan Fund (Fund) was established in 1961 upon the death of
Marion Houghtelin Hart (Donor) pursuant to these instructions in her will:
111

I do hereby give, bequeath and devise a 4542041 MM .... part of my said residual
estate to the Trustees of the University of Florida at Gainesville, Florida, IN TRUST,
nevertheless, the annual income therefrom to be made available for loan purposes to
students of the College of Law.upon such terms as the said Trustees, in their sole
discretion, may deem advisable. It is my will and I hereby direct that the foregoing gift
be known as the Eldridge Hart Loan Fund.1
6. In 1993, the Fund, along with more than a dozen other funds, was the subject of an
Order on Petition to Apply Cy Pres Doctrine that transferred the Fund from the University to the
Foundation (Case No.: 01-92-03888-CA). At that time, no modifications were requested or
made to the Fund's purpose and name.
7. In accordance with the Donor's intent, the Foundation administered the Fund so that
the annual spendable income was made available for loans to students at the University's Levin
College of Law (College). Over time, however, the Fund has not been used for three reasons.
First, most students who seek loans also apply for federal student aid, which was not available in
its current form at the time of the Donor's bequest. As a practical matter, federal student aid
packages become complicated when students receive additional loans from other sources.
Consequently, students have not applied for loans from this Fund. Second, the Fund is much
larger than needed for the few loans that have been requested. The Fund has been used
occasionally for short-term loans for registration fees, study abroad fees, and emergency
situations. However, the amount loaned has been much smaller than the amount that is available.
Third, the College's efforts to document and monitor the loans have been significant relative to
the benefits provided to the few students who have requested loans. For all these reasons, the
Fund has become impracticable or impossible to administer, thus frustrating the Donor's wish to
benefit the University and to help students at the College.
Information that is not relevant to this petition has been redacted to protect the Donor's privacy. In addition, we
note that Section 1004.28, Florida Statutes, makes most of the Foundation's records confidential and exempt from
Section 119.07(1), Florida Statutes,
2

8. The Fund is an endowment fund and, as such, it is invested according to Foundation
policies to support the Donor's purpose in perpetuity. Spendable income from the Fund is
transferred quarterly to the University, in accordance with Foundation policies. However,
because the College has not been able to use the transferred monies for loans, the College has
maintained a high balance in its spendable income account or has returned the spendable income
to the Foundation to be added back to the principal balance in the Fund.
9. As of May 2016, the market value of the principal balance was $646,003.73 and the
spendable income balance was $36,097.62. Under Foundation policies, under current conditions,
an estimated $24,500 would be made available to the College annually, if the College were able
to use the funds.
10. To best accomplish the Donor's charitable purpose, to fulfill the Foundation's
fiduciary obligations' to the Donor and to the University, and to have the College benefit from the
bequest as intended by the Donor, it is necessary that the purpose and name of the Fund be
modified pursuant to Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla. Stat. (2015).
11. Written consent of the Donor could not be obtained by reason of the Donor's death.
The Donor's spouse is also deceased. After a diligent search, no children or grandchildren have
been found. (See Exhibit 1, Affidavit.)
12. The Foundation requests that the purpose and name of the Fund be modified from
loans to scholarships as follows:
The Eldridge Hart Loan Fund, established in 1961 through the bequest of Marion
Houghtelin Hart to provide loans to College students, will be known as the Eldridge Hart
Scholarship Fund, and the spendable income will be made available to the College for
scholarship purposes.
3

13. The Foundation has provided notice of this petition to the Attorney General of the
State of Florida as required by Section 617.2104(6)(e), Fla. Stat. (2015). (See Exhibit 2, Notice.)
14. The Foundation will continue to hold, manage, and invest the Fund to be used for the
benefit of the University, in accordance with Foundation policies and the Donor's wishes as
modified by the Court.
WHEREFORE, the Foundation requests this Court to enter an Order modifying the
purpose and name of the Fund to serve the intent of the Donor to benefit the University of
Florida and students at the Levin College of Law.

RE: Notice of Petition to Apply Cy Pres Doctrine
Dear Attorney General Bondi:
Section 617.2104(6)(e), Florida Statutes, requires that the Attorney General be notified of a
request to a circuit court to modify the charitable purpose contained in a gift instrument.
Toward that end, we enclose a copy of a Petition to Apply Cy Pres Doctrine that we intend to
file.
The gift instrument is the will of a donor who died in 1961. The donor's spouse is also
deceased, and a search failed to locate any children or grandchildren. The will states that the
gift be used for student loans. However, for reasons stated in the petition, over time, loans of
this type have become impracticable or impossible to administer. Therefore, we will request
that the purpose and name be modified from ""loans"" to ""scholarships."" We believe that this
modification is consistent with the Donor's intent.
With respect to the enclosed petition, we note that Section 1004.28, Florida Statutes, protects
donor identities and makes most of our records confidential and exempt from Section
119.07 (1), Florida Statutes.
If you or your staff have questions or concerns, please ,feel free to contact me at (352) 392-

TAX ATTORNEYS FEES
""2013 CA 002182"" 1637478 Filed at Alachua County Clerk 04/29/13 08:15:00 AM EDT

Comes Now, Plaintiff Lori K. BATTAILE, to sue Defendants alleges as follows:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
1. At all relevant times, Plaintiff Lori Battailc has been and is an individual residing in Alachua
County, Florida.
2. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at all relevant times Defendant
Ghaffar (""Ghaffar"") is a physician licensed to practice medicine in Florida and does so
within the ""UF Shands"" healthcare system.
3. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at all relevant times Defendant
Shand's Teaching Hospital and Clinics Inc. (""Shands""), has been and is a corporation duly
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Florida, with its principal place of
business in Gainesville, Alachua County, Florida.
4. Defendant University of Florida (""UF""), through the Board of Trustee's as the governing
agency of UF, together with Shands, developed a healthcare group, d/b/a UF Shands (""UF
Shands""), which regularly conducts business is Alachua County, Fl.
5. Defendant Walgreens Co. is a Florida corporation doing business in Alachua County, Fl.
6. Defendants DOES I through 10, inclusive, are sued herein under fictitious names. Their true
names and capacities are presently unknown to Plaintiff. When said true names and
capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend this Complaint by inserting such information.
Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named
Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences alleged herein and Plaintiffs
damages were proximately caused by said Defendants.
7. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at all times relevant, each
individual Defendant, including the DOE Defendants, was the agent, servant, representative

and/or employee of each of the other Defendants, and that in doing the things hereinafter
alleged, each Defendant was acting within the course and scope of his, her or its authority as
such agent, servant, representative and/or employee, with the permission, knowledge,
consent and ratification of each of the other Defendants.
8. Unless otherwise indicated, all Defendants, including DOES defendants, are collectively
referred to herein as the ""Defendants"".
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION
9. Plaintiff is a consumer protection attorney, volunteer, mother active in her children's school
and upstanding citizen of Gainesville, Fl., small, tight knit community.
10. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges Defendants initiated a gossip campaign
against her.
11. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a patient of and designated as her primary care physician,
the UF Shands Eastside Community Practice (""Eastside Clinic""), specifically, Defendant
Dr. Ghaffar. Eastside clinic is listed as a clinic within the UF Shands healthcare group.
12. At all relevant times, Plaintiff's children were patients of and designated as their primary
care physician, the UF Shands Eastside Community Practice.
13. On information and belief, Eastside clinic is a small practice, sharing one- half of a building
and consisting of 4 (four) physicians.
14. Defendant Dr. Ghaffar and other physicians in the practice have examined both the Plaintiff
and the plaintiff's children.
15. Plaintiff was referred to Eastside by friends in the community, including her children's
teacher and another attorney.
16. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Defendants made false and
malicious statements with regard to Plaintiff and her character.

17. In approximately February, 2012, the individual Defendants Ghaffar and DOE 1 verbalized
to each other that Plaintiff was abusing narcotics and using different pharmacies around
town to do so. The statements are commonly understood as a crime and thus are actionable
per se. (See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 570-74).
18. Defendants then republished the slanderous statements to and in front of several other
individuals including those within their employ and industry.
19. Defendant Walgreens ""flagged"" Plaintiffs account as problematic for all to see.
20. Defendant Walgreens imposed an ID approval on Plaintiffs account for all prescription
pickups.
21. Defendant Walgreens announced the ""flagging"" and ID requirement to the Plaintiff both over
the phone while others were present and again in person with others in line next to and
behind her.
22. For no reason except to embarrass and intimidate her, Defendant Walgreens imposed the
restriction on her children's account, announcing such restriction in front of others.
23. Prior to this time, Defendant Walgreens had, with little exception, ordered all refills and filled
all prescriptions for both the Plaintiff and her children. At no time did Defendant Walgreens
suggest or make Plaintiff aware that there were any issues, conflicts or any other matter of
concern.
24. On February 13, 2013, Plaintiff requested a refill for her prescriptions of tramadol and
toparimate.
25. On February 15, 2013, Plaintiff received a certified letter from Defendants Ghaffar
and UF Shands, stating in pertinent part:
... ""your medical care at UF Shands...will be terminated...we will provide you
with emergency care only...""

""We are taking this action because of problematic behaviors associated with
narcotics...""
No further information was given and no opportunity for recourse was provided.
26. Neither toparimate nor tramadol are ""narcotics"". Therefore, the published statement that the
Plaintiff has warranted termination from the UF Shand's practice ""because of problematic
behaviors associated with narcotics"" is completely libelous, defames Plaintiff and is clearly
suggestive of a crime.
27. As medical professionals, Defendants knew or should have known that Plaintiff's
prescriptions were not narcotics.
28. Several persons and agencies were copied on the letter, including Plaintiffs' insurance, and it
was submitted into Plaintiffs permanent medical file.
29. These statements were understood by those who heard them and expressly identified the
Plaintiff , in a way that defamed the reputation of Plaintiff as a respected professional, a
mother and primary care-giver, and a responsible member of the community.
30. Gainesville is a small, tight knit community. It is obvious and foreseeable that these libelous
accusations would cause severe harm not just to Plaintiffs character, but also professionally
in the small circle of attorneys, whose financial survival depends almost entirely on
reputation; and medically within a small community whose health care is run predominately
by UF Shand's.
31. All Defendants were aware that at the time the libelous statements were made and Plaintiff
was shunned and banned from Eastside Clinic, Plaintiff's child whose primary care was also
Eastside Clinic,was extremely ill, requiring monitoring, emergency treatment, labs and scans,
and several follow up appointments with Eastside Clinic and various UF Shands medical
departments including nephrology, neurology, and urology, radiology, orthopedics and lab.

32. Plaintiff was extremely distressed, frantic and overcome with fear that her very ill child was
not going to receive medical attention.
33. The defamatory statements made and as described herein could affect not only Plaintiff's
reputation and ability to retain clients, but also her license to practice, and, as an only parent,
impact her and her children's only source of livelihood, if not retracted.
34. Despite Defendants knowledge of the falsity oftheir statements and Plaintiff's requests for
retraction, Defendants have refused to do so.
35. Plaintiff has been ""terminated"" from Eastside Clinic, expressly denied by at least two other
physician practices, as well as any associated with UF Shands, as a direct result of
Defendants slander and libel. Plaintiff has been unable to secure a new primary doctor, and
has, for several months, gone untreated for her existing, persistent and chronic medical
conditions, as well as being refused treatment for an urgent request.
36. Because of the aforementioned actions, Plaintiff has endured humiliation, restrictive access
and express denial to healthcare, embarrassment, depression, severe anxiety, weight loss,
severe headaches, extreme emotional and mental anguish physical debilitation.
37. Plaintiff has also incurred damages and expenses related to the loss of healthcare, the duress,
and the affect on her reputation.
38. Defendants UF Shands is by far the dominating medical practice in Gainesville, and all of
Alachua County, reaching into Jacksonville and throughout Florida.
39. On information and belief, UF Shands has an electronic centralized patient care system for
use by all or many of its members and affiliates in which the aforementioned defamatory
remarks could be seen by all who use it.
40. Walgreens is a dominating pharmacy in Gainesville, Alachua County, and, in fact, a leading
pharmacy in all the country.

41. On information and belief, Walgreens has an electronic centralized patient care system for
use by all or many of its members and affiliates in which the aforementioned defamatory
remarks could be seen by all who use it.
42. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Defendants and each of them,
made the foregoing statements recklessly, negligently, and in some cases, with the specific
intent to discredit, shun and injure Plaintiff in her profession, her community, in her ability
to receive adequate health and other medical care, and to her children.
43. Simialr to Slander per se, damages are presumed in libel. Where, however, proof of intent,
malice or careless disregard is shown, exemplary or puntitive damages may be awarded.

expressly identitfying the Plaintiff , in a way that defamed the reputation of Plaintiff as a

community.
58. Defendants, as healthcare professionals, knew or should have known that the statements

59. In addition to the harm presumed by law, the wrongful conduct of Defendants, and each of

by reference.
67. Defendant Walgreens and Does (""Defendants WD"") acted as agent, provider and facilitator
for and on behalf of Plaintiff with respect to her prescriptions.

assumed a duty of care in addition to that owed under Section 465.003 (6), Florida Statutes,
as amended.
69. Defendant Walgreens, by and through its pharmacists' Defendant Does, negligently
performed its assumed and/or agreed to responsibilities and breached their duty of care by:
i. Failing to inform and/or label Plaintiffs prescription tramadol or toparimate as to its

being in control of the (re)ordering and, in fact, submiting all reorder requests;

required by Medicaid, which, had they done so, would have provided a secondary
preventative measure against early refills, if there be any, by their refusal to insure;
iv. Failing to counsel Plaintiff despite, on information and belief, counselling with her
physician;
v. Negligently submitting, reordering, filling and/or dispensing prescriptions.
70. Defendant negligently carried out its duty to dispense, label and inform Plaintiff and make
